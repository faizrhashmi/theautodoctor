## 2. Favorites Management System

### Database Table
Uses existing `customer_favorites` table created in Phase 1:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_favorites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  mechanic_id UUID REFERENCES mechanics(id),
  workshop_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),

  -- Stats (auto-updated)
  added_at TIMESTAMP,
  last_service_at TIMESTAMP,
  total_services INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  total_spent DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,

  UNIQUE(customer_id, mechanic_id),
  UNIQUE(customer_id, workshop_id)
);
```

### API Endpoints Created

**GET** `/api/customer/favorites`
- Retrieves customer's favorite providers
- Includes provider details (name, type)
- Shows service stats (count, total spent)
- Sorted by last service date

**POST** `/api/customer/favorites`
- Adds a provider to favorites
- Validates not already favorited
- Supports both workshops and independent mechanics

**DELETE** `/api/customer/favorites/[favoriteId]`
- Removes a provider from favorites
- Immediate deletion

---

## 3. Add to Favorites Component

**File:** `src/components/customer/AddToFavorites.tsx`

**Reusable Component:**
```typescript
<AddToFavorites
  customerId={customerId}
  providerId={providerId}
  providerName={providerName}
  providerType="workshop" | "independent"
  isFavorited={false}
  onFavoriteChange={(isFavorited) => {}}
/>
```

**Features:**
- Heart icon (filled when favorited)
- Toggleable (add/remove)
- Loading state
- Error handling
- Callback on change

**Can be used:**
- On quote pages
- After service completion
- On provider profile pages
- Anywhere customer interacts with provider

---

## Customer Retention Strategy

### Favorites System Benefits

#### 1. **Quick Rebooking**
```
Traditional Flow:
Customer needs service
→ Search for mechanic
→ Browse options
→ Review profiles
→ Book session
(5 steps, high friction)

Favorites Flow:
Customer needs service
→ Click "My Favorites"
→ Click "Book Again"
(2 steps, low friction)
```

**Result:** 60% reduction in booking friction

#### 2. **Relationship Building**
- Customers build trust with specific providers
- Providers incentivized to maintain quality
- Repeat business increases provider revenue
- Platform retains customers through relationships

#### 3. **Data-Driven Insights**
```sql
-- Most popular providers
SELECT
  provider_id,
  COUNT(*) as favorite_count,
  AVG(total_spent) as avg_customer_value
FROM customer_favorites
GROUP BY provider_id
ORDER BY favorite_count DESC;

-- Customer loyalty
SELECT
  customer_id,
  COUNT(*) as favorited_providers,
  SUM(total_spent) as lifetime_value
FROM customer_favorites
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

---

## Automatic Stats Tracking

### Trigger: Update Favorites After Service

When a quote is completed, automatically update favorites stats:

```sql
-- Trigger function to update customer_favorites stats
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_favorite_stats()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Only update if quote was approved and completed
  IF NEW.status = 'completed' AND OLD.status != 'completed' THEN
    -- Update for workshop or mechanic
    UPDATE customer_favorites
    SET
      last_service_at = NEW.work_completed_at,
      total_services = total_services + 1,
      total_spent = total_spent + NEW.customer_total
    WHERE customer_id = NEW.customer_id
      AND (
        (workshop_id = NEW.workshop_id AND NEW.workshop_id IS NOT NULL)
        OR
        (mechanic_id = NEW.mechanic_id AND NEW.mechanic_id IS NOT NULL AND NEW.workshop_id IS NULL)
      );
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Apply trigger to repair_quotes
CREATE TRIGGER update_favorites_on_completion
  AFTER UPDATE ON repair_quotes
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_favorite_stats();
```

**This means:**
- Favorites stats update automatically
- No manual tracking needed
- Always accurate data
- Real-time updates

## Quick Rebooking Flow

## Integration with Existing Systems

### After Quote Approval
When customer approves a quote, show "Add to Favorites" option:

```typescript
// In customer quote approval interface
{quote.status === 'approved' && !isFavorited && (
  <div className="mt-4 p-4 bg-blue-50 rounded-lg">
    <p className="text-sm text-blue-800 mb-2">
      Had a good experience with {providerName}?
    </p>
    <AddToFavorites
      customerId={customerId}
      providerId={providerId}
      providerName={providerName}
      providerType={providerType}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

### After Service Completion
Prompt customer to favorite the provider:

```typescript
// In service completion notification
{
  "title": "Service Completed!",
  "message": "Your service has been completed. Add [Provider] to favorites for quick rebooking?",
  "actions": [
    "Add to Favorites",
    "Not Now"
  ]
}
```
