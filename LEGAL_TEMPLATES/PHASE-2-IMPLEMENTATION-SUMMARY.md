# PHASE 2: COMPLIANCE INFRASTRUCTURE - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2025-12-07
**Purpose:** Technical implementation of OCPA compliance systems

---

## OVERVIEW

Phase 2 builds the technical infrastructure to enforce Ontario Consumer Protection Act (OCPA) requirements at the database level. This phase implements:

1. **Quote Enforcement System** - Prevents work from starting without customer acceptance
2. **10% Variance Protection** - Enforces customer approval for cost increases >10%
3. **Warranty Disclosure System** - Comprehensive warranty tracking and claim management
4. **Compliance Dashboard** - Real-time monitoring views for workshops and administrators

---

## MIGRATIONS CREATED

### 1. Quote Enforcement (OCPA Compliance)
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251207000001_quote_enforcement_ocpa_compliance.sql`

**What it does:**
- Extends `repair_quotes` table with OCPA-required fields:
  - Written estimate tracking (when provided, when accepted)
  - Customer acceptance method (digital signature, email, phone, in-person)
  - Parts and labor breakdown (itemized estimates)
  - Warranty disclosure fields
  - Quote expiry dates
  - Work authorization tracking

- Creates `quote_acceptance_log` table:
  - Audit trail of all customer quote acceptances
  - Snapshot of accepted quote (in case it changes later)
  - Consent checkboxes (parts breakdown, labor breakdown, warranty, 10% rule)
  - IP address and user agent tracking for legal proof

- **Database Trigger:** `enforce_quote_acceptance_before_work()`
  - BLOCKS work from starting if quote not accepted (raises exception)
  - BLOCKS work on expired quotes
  - Only enforces for repair quotes (not diagnostic-only)

- Creates `ocpa_quote_compliance_status` view:
  - Real-time compliance status for all quotes
  - Shows which quotes violate OCPA
  - Identifies missing itemized breakdowns, missing warranty disclosures

- Creates `ocpa_compliance_alerts` table:
  - Automated alerts for compliance violations
  - Severity levels: info, warning, critical, violation
  - Alert types: missing breakdown, missing warranty, quote expiring, work started without acceptance

- **Function:** `record_quote_acceptance()`
  - Records customer acceptance with full audit trail
  - Verifies all required confirmations (parts, labor, warranty, 10% rule)
  - Creates snapshot of accepted quote
  - Updates quote status to "accepted" and authorizes work

**OCPA Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ Written estimates before work begins (O. Reg. 17/05, s. 56(1))

  - Tracks reason for variance (additional parts, unforeseen damage, etc.)
  - Workshop contact attempts (OCPA requires attempt to contact)
  - Customer response (approved, declined, negotiating)
  - **Generated column:** `ocpa_compliant` - auto-checks if variance complies with 10% rule

- Creates `quote_variance_approval_log` table:
  - Audit trail of all variance request actions
  - Tracks variance_requested, customer_notified, approved, declined, etc.

- **Database Trigger:** `detect_quote_variance_violation()`
  - Runs when work is marked as completed
  - Calculates variance between original accepted cost and final cost
  - **BLOCKS work completion if variance > 10% without customer approval**
  - Raises OCPA violation exception with exact percentage

- **Function:** `approve_quote_variance()`
  - Customer approval workflow
  - Records approval method, IP address, user agent
  - Logs compliance event
  - Authorizes work to continue

- **Function:** `decline_quote_variance()`

  - Identifies expired requests (customer didn't respond)
  - Compliance status: compliant, work_stopped, expired_violation, pending_approval

**OCPA Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ Final cost cannot exceed estimate by >10% without written customer approval (O. Reg. 17/05, s. 56(3))
- ✅ Attempt to contact customer for approval
- ✅ Audit trail of customer approval/decline

## LEGAL PROTECTION STRATEGY

### How This System Protects The Platform:

1. **Proof of Compliance:**
   - Every quote acceptance is logged with timestamp, IP address, user agent
   - Audit trail shows customer was informed of all requirements
   - If customer sues workshop, Platform can prove: "We enforced the law"

2. **Automated Enforcement:**
   - Database triggers BLOCK non-compliant actions
   - No workshop can bypass OCPA requirements
   - No developer can accidentally introduce compliance bugs

3. **Transparency:**
   - Compliance dashboard shows real-time status
   - Workshops can self-correct before violations occur
   - Platform can identify and address issues proactively

4. **Shared Responsibility:**
   - System provides tools for compliance
   - Workshops are responsible for using them correctly
   - Platform indemnification protected by technical safeguards

## NEXT STEPS (PHASE 3)

After Phase 2 technical infrastructure, Phase 3 will focus on:

1. **Privacy & Consent UI:**
   - Implement explicit consent checkboxes in signup form
   - Add unsubscribe links to all email templates
   - Build user data access portal (PIPEDA right to access)
   - Implement data deletion workflow (PIPEDA right to deletion)

2. **Customer Disclosure UI:**
   - Implement disclosures from `LEGAL_TEMPLATES/customer-disclosures-TO-IMPLEMENT.md`
   - Homepage disclaimer
   - Quote acceptance page with OCPA requirements
   - Referral fee disclosure (Competition Act)
   - Terms acceptance with explicit checkboxes

3. **Quote Acceptance UI:**
   - Quote acceptance page with itemized breakdown
   - Warranty disclosure with checkbox confirmations
   - 10% rule acknowledgment checkbox
   - Digital signature capture

4. **Variance Approval UI:**
   - Customer notification when variance >10% is detected
   - Variance approval/decline interface
   - Revised quote display with highlighted changes

5. **Warranty Claim UI:**
   - Customer portal to file warranty claims
   - Photo/video upload
   - Workshop response tracking
   - Resolution feedback

## MIGRATION DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** These migrations modify critical tables. Deploy during low-traffic period.

### Deployment Order:
1. `20251206000001_add_legal_compliance_fields.sql` (Phase 1 - already deployed?)
2. `20251207000001_quote_enforcement_ocpa_compliance.sql`
3. `20251207000002_quote_variance_protection_10_percent_rule.sql`
4. `20251207000003_warranty_disclosure_system.sql`
5. `20251207000004_workshop_compliance_dashboard.sql`

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] All migrations run without errors
- [ ] Database triggers fire correctly (test with sample data)
- [ ] Views return data without errors
- [ ] Compliance scores calculate correctly
- [ ] Alert generation works
- [ ] Variance detection triggers correctly

### Rollback Plan:
If issues arise, migrations can be rolled back in reverse order. However, note:
- Triggers prevent non-compliant actions (this is by design)
- If triggers are too strict, may need to adjust logic rather than rollback
- Views can be dropped without data loss

## PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

**Indexes Added:**
- `repair_quotes`: work_authorized, customer_accepted_at, quote_expired, valid_until
- `quote_acceptance_log`: quote_id, customer_id, workshop_id, accepted_at
- `quote_variance_requests`: original_quote_id, workshop_id, customer_id, status, exceeds_10_percent
- `warranty_claims`: quote_id, workshop_id, customer_id, status, valid, filed_date
- `ocpa_compliance_alerts`: workshop_id, resolved, severity

**Expected Query Performance:**
- Compliance dashboard: <500ms (uses indexed joins)
- Quote acceptance: <100ms (single row insert + update)
- Variance detection: <50ms (triggered on update)

**Optimization Recommendations:**
- Run `ANALYZE` on tables after migration
- Monitor slow queries with `pg_stat_statements`
- Consider materialized view for `workshop_compliance_dashboard` if >1000 workshops

## COMPLIANCE MONITORING CRON JOBS

**Recommended scheduled tasks:**

```sql
-- Daily: Check for expiring insurance (email workshops 30 days before expiry)
SELECT * FROM workshop_compliance_dashboard
WHERE insurance_status = 'expiring_soon';

-- Daily: Check for expiring warranties (email customers 30 days before expiry)
SELECT * FROM warranties_expiring_soon;

-- Daily: Check for unresolved critical alerts
SELECT * FROM compliance_alert_dashboard
WHERE severity IN ('critical', 'violation') AND resolved = false;

-- Weekly: Refresh compliance scores
SELECT * FROM refresh_compliance_scores();

-- Monthly: Generate compliance report for administrators
SELECT * FROM platform_compliance_summary;

-- Quarterly: Check data retention (PIPEDA: delete data >7 years old)
SELECT * FROM customer_data_privacy_compliance
WHERE data_retention_status = 'retention_review_required';
```
