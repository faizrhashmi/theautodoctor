## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

**Pages that MUST have disclosures:**

- [ ] Homepage (marketplace disclaimer)
- [ ] Customer signup (terms acceptance + marketplace understanding)
- [ ] Quote acceptance page (workshop responsibility)
- [ ] Mechanic escalation page (referral fee disclosure to mechanic)
- [ ] Session confirmation page/email (independent contractor notice)
- [ ] RFQ posting page (how marketplace works)
- [ ] Dispute filing page (workshop responsibility + Platform's role)
- [ ] Site footer (disclaimer on all pages)

**Legal Protection Strategy:**

1. **Repetition:** Show disclosure multiple times (signup, quote, booking, email)
2. **Clarity:** Use plain language, not legal jargon
3. **Checkboxes:** Require affirmative consent for key points
4. **Visibility:** Don't hide in fine print - make prominent
5. **Consistency:** Same message across all touchpoints

---

## LEGAL REASONING

**Why These Disclosures Protect The Platform:**

1. **Agency Law:** If customers believe Platform is the workshop's agent, Platform could be liable. Disclosures make it clear workshops are independent.

2. **Misrepresentation:** If Platform doesn't disclose referral fees, could violate Competition Act. Disclosures provide transparency.

3. **Consumer Protection:** If customers think Platform is the repair shop, could sue Platform for defective work. Disclosures clarify responsibility.

4. **Contract Law:** Disclosures become part of customer agreement, limiting Platform liability.

5. **Evidence:** In litigation, repeated disclosures show Platform made good-faith effort to inform customers.

**Document Status:** IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
**Next Steps:**
1. Review with lawyer
2. Implement in UI components
3. Test that disclosures appear correctly
4. Train customer support on explaining Platform's role
