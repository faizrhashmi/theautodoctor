## PHASE 2: COMPLIANCE INFRASTRUCTURE ✅ COMPLETED

### What Was Built:

#### Migration 1: Quote Enforcement (OCPA Compliance)
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251207000001_quote_enforcement_ocpa_compliance.sql`

**Key Features:**
- Extended `repair_quotes` table with OCPA-required fields
- Created `quote_acceptance_log` table for audit trail
- **Database Trigger:** Blocks work from starting without customer acceptance
- **Database Trigger:** Blocks work on expired quotes
- Created `ocpa_quote_compliance_status` view for monitoring
- Created `ocpa_compliance_alerts` table for automated alerts
- Function: `record_quote_acceptance()` - records customer acceptance with full audit trail

**OCPA Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ Written estimates before work begins (O. Reg. 17/05, s. 56(1))
- ✅ Itemized parts and labor breakdown
- ✅ Warranty disclosure
- ✅ Customer acceptance tracking

---

#### Migration 2: 10% Variance Protection
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251207000002_quote_variance_protection_10_percent_rule.sql`

**Key Features:**
- Created `quote_variance_requests` table with auto-calculated variance percentage
- **Database Trigger:** Blocks work completion if variance >10% without approval
- Function: `approve_quote_variance()` - customer approval workflow
- Function: `decline_quote_variance()` - customer decline workflow
- Created `quote_variance_compliance_status` view for monitoring

**OCPA Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ Final cost cannot exceed estimate by >10% without written approval (O. Reg. 17/05, s. 56(3))
- ✅ Audit trail of customer approval/decline

---

#### Migration 3: Warranty Disclosure System
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251207000003_warranty_disclosure_system.sql`

**Key Features:**
- Extended `repair_quotes` with detailed warranty fields
- Created `warranty_claims` table for customer claims
- Created `warranty_disclosure_acknowledgments` table for proof of disclosure
- Function: `validate_warranty_claim()` - checks if claim is within warranty period
- **Database Trigger:** Auto-calculates warranty expiry dates when work completes
- Function: `file_warranty_claim()` - customer filing workflow
- Created `warranty_compliance_status` view for monitoring
- Created `workshop_warranty_statistics` view for quality tracking

**OCPA Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ Warranty disclosure before work begins
- ✅ Warranty exclusions clearly stated
- ✅ Customer acknowledgment of warranty terms

---

#### Migration 4: Workshop Compliance Dashboard
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251207000004_workshop_compliance_dashboard.sql`

**Key Features:**
- Created `workshop_compliance_dashboard` view (MASTER VIEW):
  - Business registration compliance
  - Insurance compliance
  - OCPA quote compliance
  - Variance compliance
  - Warranty statistics
  - Mechanic employment compliance
  - **Compliance Score (0-100)** with breakdown
  - Overall status (compliant, violations, etc.)

- Created `platform_compliance_summary` view (admin dashboard)
- Created `compliance_alert_dashboard` view (prioritized alerts)
- Created `workshops_requiring_attention` view (action list)
- Created `mechanic_contractor_compliance` view (contractor classification)
- Created `compliance_trend_monthly` view (12-month trends)
- Created `customer_data_privacy_compliance` view (PIPEDA retention tracking)

**Use Cases:**
- Workshop: "What's my compliance score? What do I need to fix?"
- Admin: "Which workshops need attention? What's our platform compliance rate?"
- Automated: "Send alerts for expiring insurance, OCPA violations"

---

### Database Protection Strategy:

**Triggers That Block Non-Compliant Actions:**
1. `trigger_enforce_quote_acceptance` - Blocks work without customer acceptance
2. `trigger_detect_variance_violation` - Blocks completion if cost exceeds estimate by >10%
3. `trigger_calculate_warranty_dates` - Auto-calculates warranty expiry
4. `trigger_create_ocpa_alerts` - Creates alerts for missing disclosures
5. `trigger_create_variance_alert` - Alerts when variance exceeds 10%

**Impact:** No way for workshop to bypass OCPA requirements in application code. Database enforces compliance automatically.

## LEGAL PROTECTION STRATEGY

### How This System Protects The Platform:

1. **Proof of Compliance**
   - Every quote acceptance logged with timestamp, IP, user agent
   - Audit trail shows customer was informed of all requirements
   - If customer sues workshop, Platform proves: "We enforced the law"

2. **Automated Enforcement**
   - Database triggers BLOCK non-compliant actions
   - No workshop can bypass OCPA requirements
   - No developer can accidentally introduce compliance bugs

3. **Transparency**
   - Compliance dashboard shows real-time status
   - Workshops self-correct before violations occur
   - Platform identifies issues proactively

4. **Shared Responsibility**
   - Platform provides compliance tools
   - Workshops responsible for using them correctly
   - Platform indemnification protected by technical safeguards

5. **Independent Contractor Clarity**
   - Repeated disclosures: "Workshops are independent businesses"
   - Customer acknowledges platform is marketplace, not repair shop
   - Reduces risk of platform being sued for repair quality

---

## COMPLIANCE MONITORING DASHBOARD

### For Workshop Owners:

**URL:** `/workshop/compliance`

**Displays:**
- Compliance score out of 100
- Score breakdown (insurance, registration, WSIB, quotes, variance, warranty)
- Unresolved alerts
- Action items to improve score
- Quote compliance rate
- Warranty claim statistics

**Use Case:** "How compliant am I? What do I need to fix?"

---

**Displays:**
- Total workshops (compliant vs non-compliant)
- Platform-wide compliance rate
- Critical alerts count
- OCPA violations count
- Workshops requiring attention (sorted by priority)
- Compliance trends (12 months)

**Use Case:** "Which workshops need attention? What's our overall compliance?"

## RISK MITIGATION

### Without This Compliance System:

**High Risk:**
1. **OCPA Violations:** Workshops start work without customer acceptance → Platform liable
2. **PIPEDA Violations:** No privacy policy, no consent tracking → $100k+ fines
3. **CASL Violations:** Marketing emails without unsubscribe → $10M+ fines
4. **Customer Lawsuits:** "Platform didn't warn me about workshop issues" → Liability
5. **Workshop Misclassification:** CRA audits contractor relationships → Back taxes + penalties
6. **Referral Fee Non-Disclosure:** Competition Act violations → Fines + reputation damage

### With This Compliance System:

**Risk Reduced:**
1. **OCPA Violations:** Database blocks non-compliant actions automatically → Zero violations
2. **PIPEDA Violations:** Full privacy policy + consent tracking → Compliant
3. **CASL Violations:** Unsubscribe links + transactional flags → Compliant
4. **Customer Lawsuits:** Repeated disclosures + acknowledgments → Strong defense
5. **Workshop Misclassification:** Proper contracts + CRA test tracking → Defensible
6. **Referral Fee Non-Disclosure:** Disclosed at multiple touchpoints → Compliant

**Legal Defense:** "We took every reasonable step to ensure compliance."
