## üìã Migration Error Fixes

### Error 1: Generated Column with Non-Immutable CURRENT_DATE
**Problem:** PostgreSQL doesn't allow `CURRENT_DATE` in generated columns
**Solution:** Removed generated column, check `quote_valid_until < CURRENT_DATE` directly in triggers

### Error 2: EXTRACT from DATE Subtraction
**Problem:** Type mismatch in `EXTRACT(DAY FROM date1 - date2)`
**Solution:** Direct subtraction (DATE - DATE = INTEGER in PostgreSQL)

### Error 3: Column `o.gst_hst_registered` Does Not Exist
**Problem:** Organizations table doesn't have this boolean column
**Solution:** Changed to `(o.tax_id IS NOT NULL) AS gst_hst_registered`

### Error 4: Relation `ocpa_quote_compliance_status` Does Not Exist
**Problem:** View creation failed due to error #1
**Solution:** Resolved by fixing error #1

### Error 5: Column `o.has_liability_insurance` Does Not Exist
**Problem:** Organizations table only has insurance detail columns
**Solution:** Changed to `(o.insurance_expiry_date IS NOT NULL AND o.insurance_coverage_amount IS NOT NULL)`
