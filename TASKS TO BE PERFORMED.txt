🚀 How to Deploy on Render
Quick Start (Recommended)
Push to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Add Render deployment config"
git push
Deploy via Blueprint:
Go to Render Dashboard
Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
Select your repository
Click "Apply"
Render auto-creates web service + cron job
Add Environment Variables:
Go to your web service settings
Add all required env vars (see RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)
Copy the CRON_SECRET to the cron job service
Run Database Migrations:
In Supabase Studio, run migrations/06_session_extensions_and_files.sql
Run migrations/07_session_summaries.sql
Create Storage Bucket:
Create session-files bucket in Supabase Storage
Add RLS policies (see deployment guide)
Test:
Visit your Render app URL
Trigger the cron job manually to test
Verify logs show successful execution
📊 Cron Job on Render
Your cron job will:
Run every 5 minutes automatically
Call /api/cron/monitor-sessions endpoint
Nudge mechanics if sessions stuck (3+ min)
Alert support if issues detected (2+ min)
Auto-end sessions running too long (3+ hours)
Send emails via Resend API
Log all actions to Render logs
Cost: $1/month for the cron job service
Alternative: Free External Cron
If you want to save $1/month, you can use a free external cron service instead:
Delete Render cron job service
Sign up at cron-job.org (free)
Create cron job:
URL: https://your-app.onrender.com/api/cron/monitor-sessions
Schedule: Every 5 minutes
Header: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
See the RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md guide for detailed instructions.


🚀 Remaining Steps Before Production
1. Run Migration 07 (2 min)
-- In Supabase Studio → SQL Editor
-- Run migrations/07_session_summaries.sql
2. Configure Environment Variables
Add to your .env.local and Vercel:
# Email service (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx
EMAIL_FROM=The Auto Doctor <noreply@theautodoctor.com>

# Support email for alerts
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@theautodoctor.com

# Cron security
CRON_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
3. Setup Playwright (optional - for testing)
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium
4. Deploy to Vercel
The vercel.json cron will automatically start running every 5 minutes in production.
