## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Emails Not Sending**
```
Problem: Approval/rejection emails not arriving
Solution:
- Check RESEND_API_KEY is set in .env.local
- Verify email domain in Resend dashboard
- Check console logs for email errors
- Emails may be in spam folder
```

**2. Workshop Not Appearing in Admin Panel**
```
Problem: New workshop application not visible
Solution:
- Check organization_type is 'workshop'
- Verify status is 'pending'
- Check admin panel filter is set to correct status
- Refresh the page
```

**3. Invite Code Invalid**
```
Problem: Mechanic can't sign up with invite code
Solution:
- Check invite hasn't expired (7 days)
- Verify invite_code matches exactly
- Check invite status is 'pending'
- Ensure workshop is 'active'
```

### Development Testing

**Testing Emails Locally:**
1. Use Resend test mode
2. Or use Mailtrap.io for email testing
3. Check console logs for email content during development

**Database Inspection:**
```sql
-- Check workshop applications
SELECT id, name, email, status, verification_status, created_at
FROM organizations
WHERE organization_type = 'workshop'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check pending invitations
SELECT om.*, o.name as workshop_name
FROM organization_members om
JOIN organizations o ON o.id = om.organization_id
WHERE om.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY om.invited_at DESC;

-- Check admin actions
SELECT *
FROM admin_actions
WHERE action_type IN ('workshop_approved', 'workshop_rejected')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Technical Notes

### Security Considerations
- Business registration numbers and tax IDs are encrypted
- Admin authentication required for approval/rejection
- Invite codes are unique and time-limited
- Email sending failures don't block main operations
- RLS policies should be in place on Supabase

### Performance Optimizations
- Workshop applications enriched with contact names in single query
- Email sending wrapped in try-catch to prevent blocking
- Dashboard stats calculated efficiently with filters
- Admin actions logged asynchronously

### Code Quality
- TypeScript with `@ts-nocheck` for rapid development
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Reusable email components
- Follow Next.js 14 app router patterns
