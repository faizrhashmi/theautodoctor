# Workshop Escalation System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The workshop escalation system enables virtual mechanics to hand off completed diagnostic sessions to workshops for repair quote creation. This creates a seamless workflow while allowing virtual mechanics to earn referral fees.

## Business Flow

```
Virtual Mechanic → Completes Diagnosis → Clicks "Escalate to Workshop"
  ↓
Platform Auto-Matches Workshop (or mechanic chooses)
  ↓
Workshop Service Advisor Receives Escalation in Queue
  ↓
Service Advisor Creates Repair Quote
  ↓
Customer Approves Quote via Platform
  ↓
Workshop Performs Repair
  ↓
Virtual Mechanic Receives 5% Referral Fee
```

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

#### 1. **workshop_escalation_queue**
Primary table for managing escalated sessions.

**Key Fields:**
- `diagnostic_session_id` - Links to the completed diagnostic
- `customer_id` - Customer who needs repairs
- `escalating_mechanic_id` - Virtual mechanic who escalated (for referral tracking)
- `assigned_workshop_id` - Workshop that will handle repairs
- `status` - pending | accepted | in_progress | quote_sent | declined | cancelled
- `priority` - low | normal | high | urgent
- `assignment_method` - auto_match | mechanic_choice | partnership
- `referral_fee_percent` - Commission % for referring mechanic (default 5%)
- `diagnosis_summary` - Mechanic's diagnosis passed to workshop
- `recommended_services` - Services recommended by mechanic
- `vehicle_info` - Denormalized vehicle details for quick access
- `mechanic_notes` - Additional notes from mechanic to workshop

#### 2. **diagnostic_sessions** (Modified)
Added escalation tracking fields:
- `escalated` - Boolean flag
- `escalated_at` - Timestamp of escalation
- `escalated_by_mechanic_id` - Referring mechanic ID
- `escalated_to_workshop_id` - Assigned workshop ID
- `escalation_status` - Current status of escalation

#### 3. **workshop_escalation_preferences**
Workshop settings for receiving escalations:
- `auto_accept_escalations` - Automatically accept incoming escalations
- `max_daily_escalations` - Capacity limit
- `accepted_service_types` - Array of service types workshop handles
- `service_radius_km` - How far they'll serve customers
- `preferred_cities` - Cities where workshop operates
- `accepting_new_customers` - Currently accepting work
- `typical_quote_turnaround_hours` - Response time expectation

#### 4. **mechanic_escalation_stats**
Track virtual mechanic performance:
- `total_escalations` - Number of sessions escalated
- `escalations_accepted` - How many workshops accepted
- `escalations_quoted` - How many resulted in quotes
- `escalations_converted` - How many customers approved repairs
- `total_referral_fees_earned` - Revenue from referrals
- `total_referral_fees_pending` - Unpaid referral fees
- `average_workshop_rating` - Quality of escalations
- `average_customer_satisfaction` - Customer feedback

### Database Triggers

**1. Auto-Update Diagnostic Session**
When escalation is created, automatically updates `diagnostic_sessions` table with escalation details.

**2. Update Escalation Stats**
Automatically increments mechanic stats when:
- Workshop accepts escalation
- Quote is sent
- Customer approves quote

### Matching Algorithm

**Function: `find_matching_workshops()`**

Scores workshops based on:
- **Distance Score (0-100)**: Preferred cities get 100, others get 50
- **Capacity Score (0-100)**: Accepting new customers = 100
- **Rating Score (0-100)**: Workshop rating × 20

Returns top 5 workshops sorted by total score.

  - Customer details
  - Referring mechanic
  - Diagnosis summary
  - Recommended services
  - Mechanic notes
  - Referral fee percentage
- "Accept Escalation" button for pending items
- "Create Quote" button for accepted items

**User Flow:**
1. Service advisor logs into workshop account
2. Navigates to Escalations page
3. Sees queue of escalated diagnostics
4. Reviews diagnosis and recommendations
5. Clicks "Accept Escalation"
6. Status updates to "accepted"
7. Clicks "Create Quote" to price out repairs
8. Proceeds to standard quote creation flow

## Referral Fee System

### How It Works

1. **Escalation Created**: Default 5% referral fee set
2. **Workshop Creates Quote**: Quote total recorded
3. **Customer Approves**: Referral fee calculated as 5% of repair total
4. **Repair Completed**: Referral fee becomes payable
5. **Payment Processing**: Platform pays mechanic referral fee

### Tracking

- **mechanic_escalation_stats** table tracks all metrics
- Mechanics can view pending and earned fees
- Admin dashboard shows referral fee payouts
- Reports available for tax purposes

### Example

- Diagnostic session: $25 (already paid to virtual mechanic)
- Escalation occurs
- Workshop quotes: $1,200 for repairs
- Customer approves and pays $1,200
- Workshop receives: $1,140 (after platform fee)
- Virtual mechanic receives: $60 (5% of $1,200)
- **Total mechanic earnings: $85 from one session**

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems

1. **Diagnostic Sessions**: Escalation extends completed diagnostics
2. **Repair Quotes**: Workshop creates quote for escalated session
3. **Role Permissions**: Service advisors can view/accept escalations
4. **Workshop Dashboard**: New "Escalations" menu item
5. **Mechanic Earnings**: Referral fees added to statements

### Future Enhancements

1. **Partnership System**: Pre-arranged mechanic-workshop partnerships
2. **Manual Workshop Selection**: Let mechanic choose specific workshop
3. **Customer Preferences**: Customer can specify preferred workshops
4. **Rating System**: Customers rate workshop service
5. **Automatic Payouts**: Referral fees paid automatically via Stripe
6. **Geographic Matching**: Enhanced location-based matching
7. **Specialization Matching**: Match based on repair type expertise

## Revenue Model

### Platform Benefits

1. **Increased Transaction Value**: Converts diagnostics into repairs
2. **Retention**: Keeps transactions on platform
3. **Multiple Fees**: Earns from both diagnostic AND repair
4. **Network Effects**: More mechanics → more workshops → more repairs

### Mechanic Benefits

1. **Recurring Revenue**: Earn from referrals without doing repairs
2. **Customer Value**: Provide full-service solution
3. **Time Efficiency**: Focus on diagnostics (their expertise)
4. **Scalability**: Refer multiple jobs simultaneously

### Workshop Benefits

1. **Pre-Qualified Leads**: Diagnosis already completed
2. **Detailed Information**: Mechanic notes speed up quoting
3. **Higher Conversion**: Customer already invested in diagnosis
4. **Efficient Workflow**: Service advisors receive structured data

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- No customer contact information exposed to virtual mechanics
- All communication through platform messenger
- Workshop sees only necessary repair information
- PII access restricted by role permissions

### Authorization

- Mechanics can only escalate their own completed sessions
- Workshops only see escalations assigned to them
- Service advisors can accept but not delete escalations
- Admin oversight on all escalations
