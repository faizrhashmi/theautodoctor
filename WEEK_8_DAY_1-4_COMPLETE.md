## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

**Option A: Using Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)**

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://app.supabase.com
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the ENTIRE contents of this file:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/20250128000000_add_partnership_system.sql
   ```
5. Paste into the SQL editor
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)
7. Wait for completion (should take 5-10 seconds)
8. You should see: "‚úÖ Phase 3 Partnership System Migration Complete"

**Option B: Using psql Command Line**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "c:\Users\Faiz Hashmi\theautodoctor"

# Run the migration (replace with your Supabase connection string)
psql "postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres" -f supabase/migrations/20250128000000_add_partnership_system.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check if all tables were created
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
  'workshop_partnership_programs',
  'partnership_applications',
  'partnership_agreements',
  'bay_bookings',
  'partnership_revenue_splits',
  'mechanic_clients',
  'mechanic_earnings_breakdown'
)
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Should return 7 rows (all the new tables)

-- Check if mechanics table was updated
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'mechanics'
AND column_name IN (
  'service_tier',
  'partnership_type',
  'can_perform_physical_work',
  'prefers_virtual',
  'prefers_physical'
)
ORDER BY column_name;

-- Should return 5 rows (all new columns added to mechanics table)
```

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend Code

**If using Vercel:**
```bash
# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 3: Add virtual-only mechanic onboarding system"
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy
```

**If running locally for testing:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Flow

**Test URL:** `http://localhost:3000/mechanic/onboarding/service-tier`
(or your production domain)

**Test Flow:**
1. **Login as mechanic** (or create new mechanic account)
2. **Navigate to** `/mechanic/onboarding/service-tier`
3. **Select "Virtual Consultations Only"**
4. **Complete the onboarding form:**
   - Add at least one certification
   - Enter years of experience
   - Add specializations (optional but recommended)
   - Write a bio
   - Add phone number
5. **Submit the form**
6. **Should redirect to** `/mechanics/dashboard`
7. **Check database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, service_tier, onboarding_completed, is_active, certifications, years_experience
   FROM mechanics
   WHERE service_tier = 'virtual_only'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify these work:

### Backend APIs
- [ ] GET `/api/mechanics/onboarding/service-tier` - Returns current tier
- [ ] POST `/api/mechanics/onboarding/service-tier` - Sets tier to virtual_only
- [ ] POST `/api/mechanics/onboarding/service-tier` - Sets tier to workshop_partner
- [ ] GET `/api/mechanics/onboarding/virtual-only` - Returns onboarding progress
- [ ] POST `/api/mechanics/onboarding/virtual-only` - Completes onboarding

### Frontend Pages
- [ ] `/mechanic/onboarding/service-tier` - Loads and displays correctly
- [ ] Service tier cards are clickable
- [ ] Selecting virtual_only redirects to virtual-only form
- [ ] `/mechanic/onboarding/virtual-only` - Form loads
- [ ] Can add certifications
- [ ] Can select specializations
- [ ] Form submission works
- [ ] Redirects to dashboard after completion

### Database
- [ ] Migration ran without errors
- [ ] All 7 tables created
- [ ] Mechanics table has new columns
- [ ] RLS policies are active
- [ ] Sample data can be inserted

### Integration
- [ ] Mechanic can select virtual-only tier
- [ ] Mechanic can complete onboarding
- [ ] onboarding_completed flag set to true
- [ ] is_active flag set to true
- [ ] service_tier set to 'virtual_only'
- [ ] can_perform_physical_work set to false

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails with "column already exists"
**Solution:** The column was already added. Safe to ignore, or drop and re-run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE mechanics DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS service_tier;
-- Then re-run migration
```

### Issue: "relation does not exist" error
**Solution:** Make sure you're running the migration in the correct database:
```sql
-- Check current database
SELECT current_database();

-- Should return your project name, not 'postgres'
```

### Issue: Frontend can't connect to API
**Solution:** Check cookies are set for mechanic session:
```javascript
// In browser console
document.cookie
// Should see 'aad_mech=...'
```

### Issue: Mechanic not found after login
**Solution:** Make sure mechanic exists in mechanics table:
```sql
SELECT id, name, email FROM mechanics WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
