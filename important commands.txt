IMPORTANT CODE TO REDIRECT URL:

The fix: You need to configure the Site URL and Redirect URLs in your Supabase dashboard:
Visit: https://qtkouemogsymqrzkysar.supabase.co
Go to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
Set Site URL to: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback (for local dev)
In Redirect URLs, add both:
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/customer/dashboard
When you deploy to production, update to: https://askautodoctor.com/auth/callback

http://localhost:3001/admin/cleanup
