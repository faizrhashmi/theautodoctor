# The Auto Doctor - Repair Quote System Overview
## Complete System Implementation Summary

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** ✅ All 6 Phases Complete
**Date:** January 27, 2025

---

## What Was Built

A comprehensive repair quote and fee management system for The Auto Doctor platform with:

1. **Dynamic Fee Management** - Admin-configurable fee rules without code changes
2. **Role-Separated Workshop Flow** - Mechanics diagnose, service advisors price
3. **Independent Mechanic Flow** - Combined diagnosis and quoting for solo mechanics
4. **Customer Favorites System** - Build retention with preferred provider bookmarking
5. **Session Upgrade System** - Fair pricing for chat-to-video upgrades ($15 → $35)
6. **Admin Analytics** - Real-time platform metrics and fee rule management

## Key Concepts

### 1. Fee Rule Types
- **Flat:** Fixed amount per job (e.g., $10 per quote)
- **Percentage:** % of subtotal (e.g., 15%)
- **Tiered:** Different % by job value ranges
- **Service-Based:** Different % per service category

### 2. Provider Types
- **Workshop:** Organization with mechanics and service advisors
- **Independent:** Solo mechanic (diagnoses + quotes)
- **Mobile:** On-site/mobile service with trip fees

### 3. Session Types
- **Chat:** Text-based diagnosis ($15)
- **Video:** Video call diagnosis ($35)
- **Upgraded from Chat:** Chat → Video mid-session ($15 + $20 = $35)
- **Mobile Visit:** In-person on-site service

### 4. Quote Statuses
```
pending → viewed → approved → in_progress → completed
                → declined
                → modified → pending (cycle)
```

### 5. Permission System
```
Workshop Owner:    Diagnose ✓  See Pricing ✓  Send Quotes ✓  Manage Staff ✓
Workshop Mechanic: Diagnose ✓  See Pricing ✗  Send Quotes ✗  Manage Staff ✗
Service Advisor:   Diagnose ✗  See Pricing ✓  Send Quotes ✓  Manage Staff ✗
Independent Mech:  Diagnose ✓  See Pricing ✓  Send Quotes ✓  Manage Staff N/A
```

## Critical Business Rules

### 1. Workshop Role Separation
**Rule:** Workshop mechanics NEVER see pricing. Service advisors handle all pricing.

**Why:** Maintains workshop control over margins and pricing strategy.

**Enforcement:**
- UI: Price fields hidden from mechanics
- API: Rejects mechanic requests with pricing data
- Permissions: `can_see_pricing = false` for mechanics

### 2. Fair Session Upgrade Pricing
**Rule:** Chat upgrades cost exactly the difference between chat and video prices.

**Math:**
- Chat session: $15
- Video session: $35
- Upgrade fee: $20 (not $35)
- Customer pays total: $35 (same as direct video booking)

**Why:** Fair to customers who start with chat then need video.

### 3. Priority-Based Fee Matching
**Rule:** Higher priority fee rules are checked first. First match wins.

**Example:**
```
Priority 100: Workshop jobs > $500 → 10%  ← Checked first
Priority 50:  All workshop jobs → 15%    ← Checked second
Priority 0:   Default fallback → 20%     ← Last resort
```

**Why:** Allows specific rules to override general rules.

### 4. Escrow Payment Protection
**Rule:** Customer payments held in escrow until work approved as complete.

**Flow:**
1. Customer approves quote → Payment captured → Held in escrow
2. Provider completes work → Customer approves completion
3. Platform releases payment → Provider receives payout - platform fee

**Why:** Protects both customers (quality guarantee) and providers (payment guarantee).

## Common Tasks

### Add New Fee Rule
1. Navigate to `/admin/fees`
2. Click "Create New Rule"
3. Select rule type (flat/percentage/tiered/service-based)
4. Set conditions (provider type, job value range, service categories)
5. Set priority (higher = checked first)
6. Activate rule
7. Test with sample quote

### Workshop Quote Flow
1. Customer books video diagnostic session ($35)
2. Mechanic completes diagnosis (no pricing shown)
3. Service advisor creates quote with pricing
4. Customer reviews and approves quote
5. Payment processed and held in escrow
6. Work completed and verified
7. Payment released to provider (minus platform fee)

### Independent Mechanic Quote
1. Customer books mobile diagnostic
2. Mechanic completes diagnosis + creates quote (pricing shown)
3. Adds trip fee for distance traveled
4. Customer approves quote on-site or remotely
5. Work completed immediately (mobile) or scheduled
6. Payment processed and provider paid

### Session Upgrade
1. Customer starts chat session ($15 paid)
2. Mid-session, decides video needed
3. Clicks "Upgrade to Video"
4. Pays $20 upgrade fee
5. Total paid: $35 (same as direct video)
6. Video features activate
7. Mechanic notified of upgrade

## Integration Points

### Payment Processing (Stripe)
**Status:** ⚠️ Mocked - Requires Production Integration

**Files to Update:**
- `src/app/api/sessions/upgrade/payment/route.ts:75`
- `src/app/api/quotes/[quoteId]/respond/route.ts` (when implemented)

**TODO:**
```typescript
// Current (mock):
const mockPaymentIntentId = `pi_upgrade_${session_id}`

// Production:
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: upgrade_amount * 100,
  currency: 'usd',
  customer: stripeCustomerId,
  metadata: { session_id, upgrade_type: 'chat_to_video' }
})
```

### Admin Authentication
**Status:** ⚠️ TODO - Requires Implementation

**Files to Update:**
- `src/app/api/admin/fees/rules/route.ts:11-13, 62-64`
- `src/app/api/admin/fees/rules/[ruleId]/route.ts:14, 89`

**TODO:**
```typescript
// Add admin auth check
const isAdmin = await checkAdminAuth(req)
if (!isAdmin) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

### Real-time Chat
**Status:** ❌ Not Implemented - WebSocket Needed

**Database Table:** `platform_chat_messages` (exists)

**TODO:**
- Integrate Socket.io or Pusher
- Implement message delivery
- Add typing indicators
- Message read receipts

### Video Calls
**Status:** ❌ Not Implemented - Service Integration Needed

**TODO:**
- Integrate Twilio Video or Agora
- Generate video room tokens
- Monitor call quality
- Optional: Call recording

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run fee calculator tests
npm test src/lib/fees/feeCalculator.test.ts
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test database migration
psql -f supabase/migrations/20250127000001_add_repair_quote_system.sql

# Verify tables created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('diagnostic_sessions', 'repair_quotes', ...);
```

### Manual Testing
1. Workshop Flow:
   - Mechanic completes diagnosis without pricing
   - Service advisor creates quote with pricing
   - Customer approves quote

2. Independent Flow:
   - Mechanic completes diagnosis + quote with pricing
   - Mobile visit with trip fee calculation

3. Favorites:
   - Customer adds provider to favorites
   - Quick rebook pre-fills information

4. Session Upgrade:
   - Start chat session ($15)
   - Upgrade to video (+$20)
   - Verify total = $35

5. Admin Controls:
   - Create/update/delete fee rules
   - Toggle active status
   - View analytics
