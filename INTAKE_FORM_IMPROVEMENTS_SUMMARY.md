## üß™ Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Desktop Testing (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- [ ] Click each concern category - should show sub-categories if available
- [ ] Select a sub-category - should pre-fill concern textarea with template
- [ ] Open year dropdown - should see grouped years
- [ ] Open brand dropdown - should see searchable list
- [ ] Type in brand search - should filter results
- [ ] Submit form with selected options - should work as before

#### Mobile Testing (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Tap concern categories - should have immediate feedback
