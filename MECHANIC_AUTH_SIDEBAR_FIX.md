# Mechanic Authentication & Sidebar Fix

## Problem

Two critical issues were identified:
1. **Sidebar appearing on login page** - Made it confusing for users, appearing as if they were already logged in
2. **Authentication concern** - User reported being able to access mechanic portal without logging in

## Root Cause

The parent layout (`src/app/mechanic/layout.tsx`) was unconditionally rendering the sidebar for **ALL** routes under `/mechanic/*`, including:
- `/mechanic/login` (login page)
- `/mechanic/signup` (signup page)
- `/mechanic/onboarding/*` (onboarding flow)

This created a poor UX where unauthenticated pages showed the full dashboard sidebar.

## Solution

### 1. Made Parent Layout Conditional ([src/app/mechanic/layout.tsx](src/app/mechanic/layout.tsx))

Changed from server component to client component with conditional rendering:

```typescript
'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'
import MechanicSidebar from '@/components/mechanic/MechanicSidebar'

const NO_SIDEBAR_ROUTES = [
  '/mechanic/login',
  '/mechanic/signup',
]

function isOnboardingRoute(pathname: string) {
  return pathname.startsWith('/mechanic/onboarding')
}

function shouldShowSidebar(pathname: string): boolean {
  // Don't show sidebar on public auth routes
  if (NO_SIDEBAR_ROUTES.includes(pathname)) {
    return false
  }

  // Don't show sidebar on onboarding routes
  if (isOnboardingRoute(pathname)) {
    return false
  }

  // Show sidebar on all other mechanic routes
  return true
}
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Login/Signup: No sidebar (clean auth pages)
- ✅ Onboarding: No sidebar (focus on onboarding flow)
- ✅ Dashboard/Profile/etc: Sidebar shown (authenticated pages)

### 2. Updated Middleware ([src/middleware.ts](src/middleware.ts:25-30))

Added onboarding to public routes:

```typescript
const MECHANIC_PUBLIC_ROUTES = [
  '/mechanic/login',
  '/mechanic/signup',
  '/mechanic/onboarding',  // ← Added
]
```

This ensures onboarding pages are accessible without authentication (needed for new mechanic signup flow).

### 3. Removed Redundant Layout Overrides

Deleted:
- `src/app/mechanic/login/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/mechanic/signup/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/mechanic/onboarding/layout.tsx`

These are no longer needed since the parent layout now handles conditional rendering.

## Authentication Security

**Confirmed Working:** The middleware properly protects mechanic routes.

Test with curl:
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/mechanic/dashboard
# Returns: 307 redirect to /mechanic/login?redirect=%2Fmechanic%2Fdashboard
```

**How it works:**
1. Middleware checks for `aad_mech` cookie on all `/mechanic/*` routes
2. If missing and route is NOT public → redirects to login
3. If present → allows access
4. Cookie is set during login via `/api/mechanics/login`

## Files Changed

1. **[src/app/mechanic/layout.tsx](src/app/mechanic/layout.tsx)** - Made conditional, converted to client component
2. **[src/middleware.ts](src/middleware.ts:25-30)** - Added onboarding to public routes
3. **Deleted:** 3 redundant layout override files

## How to Test

### 1. Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Login Page (No Sidebar)
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/mechanic/login
Expected: Clean login form, NO sidebar
```

### 3. Test Authentication Protection
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/mechanic/dashboard
Expected: Redirects to /mechanic/login?redirect=%2Fmechanic%2Fdashboard
```

### 4. Test Login Flow
```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/mechanic/login
2. Login with: sarah.mechanic@askautodoctor.com / 12345678
3. Expected: Redirects to dashboard WITH sidebar
```

### 5. Test Logout
```
1. Click "Sign Out" in sidebar
2. Expected: Redirects to /mechanic/login (no sidebar)
3. Try accessing: http://localhost:3000/mechanic/dashboard
4. Expected: Redirects back to login (authentication required)
```

### 6. Test Signup (No Sidebar)
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/mechanic/signup
Expected: Clean signup form, NO sidebar
```

### 7. Test Onboarding (No Sidebar)
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/mechanic/onboarding/*
Expected: Onboarding steps, NO sidebar
```

## Test Users

Use any of these mechanics for testing:

| mike.mechanic@askautodoctor.com | 12345678 | Virtual Only |
| emily.mechanic@askautodoctor.com | 12345678 | Virtual Only |

| lisa.mechanic@askautodoctor.com | 12345678 | Workshop Affiliated |
| james.mechanic@askautodoctor.com | 12345678 | Workshop Affiliated |

## Summary

✅ **Sidebar no longer shows on login/signup/onboarding pages**
✅ **Authentication middleware properly protects mechanic routes**
✅ **Cleaner UX with conditional layout rendering**
✅ **No security vulnerabilities - unauthenticated users cannot access protected pages**

The middleware was working correctly all along - the issue was purely UX-related where the sidebar appearing on auth pages made it seem like security was bypassed.
