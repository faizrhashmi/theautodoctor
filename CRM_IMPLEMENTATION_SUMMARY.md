# CRM Tracking and Upsell Recommendation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive CRM tracking and upsell recommendation system that monitors the customer journey from intake submission through session completion and generates personalized service recommendations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core CRM Service Library (`src/lib/crm.ts`)

Created a complete CRM tracking service with the following capabilities:

#### Interaction Tracking
- **`trackInteraction()`** - Records customer interactions throughout their journey
- Supported interaction types:
  - `intake_submitted` - When customer submits intake form
  - `session_started` - When session transitions to 'live'
  - `session_completed` - When session ends
  - `summary_viewed` - When customer views session summary
  - `upsell_shown` - When upsell recommendations are displayed
  - `upsell_clicked` - When customer clicks an upsell
  - `upsell_dismissed` - When customer dismisses an upsell
  - `checkout_started` - When checkout process begins
  - `checkout_completed` - When checkout completes
  - `waiver_accepted` - When customer accepts waiver

#### Upsell Management
- **`createUpsellRecommendation()`** - Creates new upsell recommendations
- **`getSessionUpsells()`** - Retrieves upsells for a specific session
- **`markUpsellShown()`** - Tracks when upsell is displayed to customer
- **`markUpsellClicked()`** - Tracks when customer clicks upsell CTA
- **`markUpsellDismissed()`** - Tracks when customer dismisses upsell
- **`markUpsellPurchased()`** - Tracks when customer purchases upsell

#### Intelligent Upsell Generation
- **`generateUpsellsForSession()`** - Automatically generates personalized upsells based on session data:
  - **For chat/video sessions**: Recommends full diagnostic package
  - **For all completed sessions**: Suggests follow-up sessions
  - **For chat-only sessions**: Offers video session upgrade
  - Prices dynamically based on previous plan tier

#### Analytics
- **`getCustomerInteractions()`** - Retrieves customer interaction history
- **`getCustomerFunnelMetrics()`** - Calculates conversion funnel metrics:
  - Total intakes submitted
  - Sessions started vs completed
  - Upsell show/click/purchase rates
  - Overall conversion rate

### 2. CRM Integration Points

#### Intake Submission ([src/app/api/intake/start/route.ts](src/app/api/intake/start/route.ts))
- Tracks when customer submits intake form
- Captures: plan selected, vehicle info, file uploads

#### Session Start ([src/app/api/sessions/[id]/start/route.ts](src/app/api/sessions/[id]/start/route.ts))
- Tracks when session transitions to 'live'
- Captures: mechanic assignment, previous status

#### Session Completion ([src/app/api/sessions/[id]/end/route.ts](src/app/api/sessions/[id]/end/route.ts))
- Tracks when session ends
- Captures: duration, plan, session type, who ended it
- **Automatically generates upsell recommendations**

#### Checkout Completion ([src/lib/fulfillment.ts](src/lib/fulfillment.ts))
- Tracks successful Stripe checkout
- Captures: plan, amount, currency, Stripe session ID

#### Summary View ([src/app/session/[id]/complete/page.tsx](src/app/session/[id]/complete/page.tsx))
- Tracks when customer views session summary
- Displays upsell recommendations

### 3. API Routes for Upsell Interactions

Created RESTful API endpoints:

- **GET `/api/sessions/[id]/upsells`** ([src/app/api/sessions/[id]/upsells/route.ts](src/app/api/sessions/[id]/upsells/route.ts))
  - Fetches upsell recommendations for a session
  - Automatically marks new upsells as "shown"
  - Tracks `upsell_shown` interaction

- **POST `/api/upsells/[id]/click`** ([src/app/api/upsells/[id]/click/route.ts](src/app/api/upsells/[id]/click/route.ts))
  - Tracks when customer clicks on an upsell
  - Records `clicked_at` timestamp
  - Triggers `upsell_clicked` CRM interaction

- **POST `/api/upsells/[id]/dismiss`** ([src/app/api/upsells/[id]/dismiss/route.ts](src/app/api/upsells/[id]/dismiss/route.ts))
  - Tracks when customer dismisses an upsell
  - Records `dismissed_at` timestamp
  - Triggers `upsell_dismissed` CRM interaction

### 4. UI Component ([src/components/session/UpsellRecommendations.tsx](src/components/session/UpsellRecommendations.tsx))

Created a beautiful, conversion-optimized upsell component:

**Features:**
- Auto-fetches upsells for the session on mount
- Displays upsells in responsive grid layout
- Each upsell card shows:
  - Recommendation type badge
  - Service title
  - Description
  - Price (if applicable)
  - "Get started" CTA button
  - Dismiss (X) button
- Tracks all interactions (shown, clicked, dismissed)
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Redirects to appropriate intake page when clicked
- Hides dismissed upsells

**Integration:**
- Integrated into [/session/[id]/complete](src/app/session/[id]/complete/page.tsx) page
- Displays automatically after session completion
- Only visible to authenticated customers

## Database Schema (Already Applied)

The CRM tables from [migrations/09_crm_and_upsells.sql](migrations/09_crm_and_upsells.sql) are already applied:

### Tables

**`crm_interactions`**
- Tracks all customer journey events
- Fields: id, customer_id, interaction_type, session_id, metadata, created_at
- Indexes on customer_id, session_id, interaction_type, created_at

**`upsell_recommendations`**
- Stores personalized service recommendations
- Fields: id, customer_id, session_id, recommendation_type, service_title, service_description, price_cents, shown_at, clicked_at, purchased_at, dismissed_at, metadata, created_at
- Indexes on customer_id, session_id, recommendation_type, shown_at

### Functions

**`track_crm_interaction()`**
- Postgres function for inserting CRM interactions
- Returns: interaction UUID

**`create_upsell_recommendation()`**
- Postgres function for creating upsells
- Returns: upsell UUID

### RLS Policies

- Customers can only read their own data
- Service role has full access
- Customers can update their own upsell interactions (click/dismiss)

## Customer Journey Flow

### Complete Conversion Funnel Tracking

1. **Intake Submission**
   - Customer fills out intake form
   - `intake_submitted` event tracked with vehicle/plan details

2. **Checkout (Paid Plans)**
   - Customer completes Stripe payment
   - `checkout_completed` event tracked with payment details

3. **Session Assignment**
   - Mechanic accepts session request
   - Session enters waiting room

4. **Session Start**
   - Both participants join
   - `session_started` event tracked

5. **Session Active**
   - Chat/video consultation in progress
   - Duration and interactions tracked

6. **Session Completion**
   - Session ends (by customer or mechanic)
   - `session_completed` event tracked
   - **Upsells automatically generated** based on:
     - Session type (chat/video/diagnostic)
     - Plan tier
     - Duration
     - Customer history

7. **Summary View**
   - Customer views session summary page
   - `summary_viewed` event tracked
   - Upsell recommendations displayed
   - `upsell_shown` events tracked

8. **Upsell Interaction**
   - Customer clicks upsell → `upsell_clicked` tracked → Redirected to intake
   - Customer dismisses → `upsell_dismissed` tracked → Hidden from view

9. **Upsell Conversion**
   - If customer purchases recommended service
   - New `intake_submitted` → `checkout_completed` cycle begins

## Business Intelligence

### Metrics Available

With the CRM system, you can now analyze:

const metrics = await getCustomerFunnelMetrics(customerId)
/*
Returns:
{
  total_intakes: 3,

## Testing the System

### Manual Testing Flow

1. **Create an intake** (free or paid plan)
   - Verify `crm_interactions` table has `intake_submitted` record

2. **Mechanic accepts and starts session**
   - Verify `session_started` interaction created

3. **End the session**
   - Verify `session_completed` interaction created
   - Verify `upsell_recommendations` table has auto-generated recommendations

4. **Visit session complete page** (`/session/[id]/complete`)
   - Should see upsell cards displayed
   - Verify `upsell_shown` interactions created

5. **Click an upsell**
   - Should redirect to intake page
   - Verify `upsell_clicked` interaction and `clicked_at` timestamp

6. **Dismiss an upsell**
   - Should hide from UI
   - Verify `upsell_dismissed` interaction and `dismissed_at` timestamp

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check all interactions for a customer
SELECT * FROM crm_interactions
WHERE customer_id = 'customer-uuid'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check upsells for a session
SELECT * FROM upsell_recommendations
WHERE session_id = 'session-uuid';

-- Check upsell performance
SELECT
  recommendation_type,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(clicked_at) as clicks,
  COUNT(purchased_at) as purchases,
  ROUND(COUNT(clicked_at)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as ctr,
  ROUND(COUNT(purchased_at)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as conversion_rate
FROM upsell_recommendations
GROUP BY recommendation_type;
```
