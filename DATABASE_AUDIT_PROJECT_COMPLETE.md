## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All migrations reviewed and approved
- [ ] Code changes reviewed and approved
- [ ] Automated tests passing locally
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Staging environment deployed and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks verified
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Team briefed on changes
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting configured
- [ ] Database backup taken

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying to production:

1. **Run Smoke Tests**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --grep @smoke
   ```

2. **Verify Key Workflows**
   - Customer session creation
   - Chat functionality
   - File uploads
   - Admin panel access

3. **Monitor Logs**
   - Check for foreign key validation errors
   - Monitor RLS policy performance
   - Watch for unexpected errors

4. **Performance Check**
   - Verify query response times
   - Check for slow queries
   - Monitor database CPU/memory

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Test Coverage Gaps**
   - Some RLS tests require authenticated contexts (skipped for now)
   - Mechanic custom auth tests incomplete

2. **Potential Breaking Changes**
   - Type validation may reject previously accepted invalid data
   - Users will see better error messages but may notice more rejections

3. **Performance Impact**
   - Pre-insert validation adds 1-2 queries per operation
   - Impact should be negligible (< 50ms)

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

1. **Stop Deployment**
2. **Revert Migrations**
   ```bash
   npx supabase migration revert
   ```
3. **Revert Code Changes**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push
   ```
4. **Verify System Stable**
5. **Investigate Root Cause**
6. **Fix and Re-Deploy**

---
