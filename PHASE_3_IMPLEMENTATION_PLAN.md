## üí∞ Financial Impact

### Platform Revenue (Conservative - Month 3)

**Virtual Consultations:**
- 100 mechanics √ó 20 sessions/month = 2,000 sessions
- Average: $25 per session √ó 15% fee = $3.75 per session
- Revenue: 2,000 √ó $3.75 = **$7,500/month**

**Workshop Partnerships:**
- 50 partnerships √ó 10 jobs/month = 500 jobs
- Average job: $500 √ó 15% fee = $75 per job
- Revenue: 500 √ó $75 = **$37,500/month**

**Total Platform Revenue: $45,000/month ($540K/year)**

### Mechanic Earnings (Examples)

**Virtual-Only (Part-time):**
- 20 sessions/month √ó $25 avg √ó 85% = **$425/month** (10 hours/month)

**Virtual-Only (Full-time):**
- 100 sessions/month √ó $25 avg √ó 85% = **$2,125/month** (50 hours/month)
