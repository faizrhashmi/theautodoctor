# Phase 2: Workshop Quote Flow - COMPLETED

## Overview
Phase 2 implements the complete workshop quote flow where mechanics diagnose vehicles and service advisors create quotes with pricing. This enforces role separation to maintain consistency and control.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema (Migration: 20250127000001_add_repair_quote_system.sql)

**9 New Tables Created:**
- `workshop_roles` - Role-based permissions for workshop team members
- `diagnostic_sessions` - Enhanced diagnostic sessions with quote tracking
- `in_person_visits` - In-person inspection visits (workshop or mobile)
- `repair_quotes` - Repair quotes sent to customers
- `quote_modifications` - Track quote changes during work
- `platform_fee_rules` - Dynamic fee calculation rules
- `repair_payments` - Payment escrow for repair orders
- `platform_chat_messages` - Platform-controlled communication
- `customer_favorites` - Customer favorite mechanics/workshops

**5 Default Fee Rules:**
- Standard Workshop Fee: 12%
- Standard Independent Fee: 12%
- Standard Mobile Fee: 12%
- Routine Maintenance Fee: 8% (for jobs under $150)
- Large Repair Discount: 10% (for jobs over $1000)

### 2. Fee Calculation Engine

**File:** `src/lib/fees/feeCalculator.ts`

**Features:**
- Dynamic fee calculation based on rules
- Multiple fee types: flat, percentage, tiered, service-based
- Priority-based rule matching
- Automatic fee rule selection

**Fee Types Supported:**
```typescript
- flat: Fixed dollar amount
- percentage: Percentage of subtotal
- tiered: Graduated fees based on job value
- service_based: Different fees per service category
```

### 3. Permission System

**File:** `src/lib/auth/permissions.ts`

**Role Permissions:**

| Role | Diagnose | Send Quotes | See Pricing | Manage Mechanics | View Analytics | Manage Settings |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Owner** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Admin** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Mechanic** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Service Advisor** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Key Insight:** Mechanics can diagnose but CANNOT see pricing. This maintains consistency and allows the workshop to control margins.

### 4. Workshop Mechanic Diagnosis Interface

**File:** `src/app/workshop/diagnostics/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- View customer and vehicle information
- Document diagnosis summary
- Add detailed findings
- Recommend services
- Set urgency level (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Categorize service type
- Add notes for service advisor
- Upload diagnostic photos
- **NO PRICING VISIBLE** - enforces role separation

**User Flow:**
1. Mechanic completes diagnostic session
2. Documents findings and recommended services
3. Submits to service advisor
4. Service advisor receives notification to create quote

### 5. Service Advisor Quote Builder

**File:** `src/app/workshop/quotes/create/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- View mechanic's diagnosis
- See customer and vehicle details
- Add labor line items (hours × rate)
- Add parts line items (quantity × unit cost)
- Real-time fee calculation
- See platform fee breakdown
- Preview customer total and provider receives
- Add customer notes and internal notes
- Set estimated completion time
- Configure warranty period
- Send quote to customer

**Pricing Display:**
```
Labor: $X.XX
Parts: $Y.YY
Subtotal: $Z.ZZ
Platform Fee (12%): $A.AA
─────────────────
Customer Total: $B.BB
You Receive: $C.CC
```

- Review line items with pricing
- View total cost breakdown
- Approve quote (proceed to payment)
- Decline quote with reason
- Add notes/questions

## Complete Workshop Quote Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Customer Books Diagnostic Session**
   - Via chat, video, or in-person
   - Describes issue with vehicle
   - Pays for diagnostic session

2. **Mechanic Performs Diagnosis**
   - Reviews customer's issue
   - Performs diagnostic (chat/video/in-person)
   - Documents findings
   - Recommends services
   - **CANNOT see pricing**
   - Submits diagnosis to service advisor

3. **Service Advisor Creates Quote**
   - Reviews mechanic's diagnosis
   - Adds labor line items (hours × rate)
   - Adds parts line items (quantity × cost)
   - Sees platform fee calculated in real-time
   - Reviews customer total and provider receives
   - Adds warranty and estimated completion
   - Sends quote to customer

4. **Customer Reviews Quote**
   - Receives notification (email/SMS/push)
   - Views quote details online
   - Reviews diagnosis and recommended services
   - Sees pricing breakdown
   - Makes decision:
     - **Approve** → Proceeds to payment
     - **Decline** → Provides reason
     - **Request Changes** → Workshop can modify

5. **Quote Approved**
   - Payment collected (via escrow)
   - Workshop notified to begin work
   - Work status tracked in system
   - Upon completion, escrow released to workshop

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Role Separation
**Why:** Mechanics focus on technical diagnosis without being influenced by pricing. Service advisors handle pricing based on workshop's margins and market rates.

**Implementation:** Role-based permissions system with explicit checks in API endpoints.

### 2. Dynamic Fee System
**Why:** Different services and job values require different fee structures. Admin needs ability to adjust fees without code changes.

**Implementation:** Database-driven fee rules with priority-based matching. Rules can be added/modified via admin interface.

### 3. Escrow Payment System
**Why:** Protect both customer (pay only for approved work) and provider (guaranteed payment upon completion).

**Implementation:** `repair_payments` table with escrow_status tracking. Payment held until work approved by customer.

### 4. Platform-Controlled Communication
**Why:** All communication goes through platform to maintain control, prevent direct contact swapping, and ensure quality.

**Implementation:** `platform_chat_messages` table with conversation_type and sender_type tracking.

### 5. Quote Modification Tracking
**Why:** During repairs, additional issues may be found. Need to track changes and get customer approval.

**Implementation:** `quote_modifications` table linking original and new quotes with change tracking.

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Components
- [x] Database migration runs successfully
- [x] Fee calculation engine works correctly
- [x] Permission system validates roles
- [x] Mechanic can complete diagnosis (no pricing visible)
- [x] Service advisor can create quote (pricing visible)
- [x] Customer can view and respond to quote
- [x] API endpoints handle errors gracefully

### 🔄 Integration Testing Needed
- [ ] End-to-end flow: diagnosis → quote → approval
- [ ] Permission enforcement in UI
- [ ] Real-time fee calculation accuracy
- [ ] Quote modification workflow
- [ ] Payment escrow creation
- [ ] Notification system (email/SMS)
- [ ] Customer favorites functionality

## Next Steps (Phase 3: Independent Mechanic Flow)

Phase 3 will adapt this system for independent/mobile mechanics who:
- Perform diagnosis AND create quotes (they see pricing)
- Have different fee structures (tiered based on job value)
- May have trip fees for mobile visits
- Don't have service advisors (one-person operation)

**Key Differences:**
- Independent mechanics have both `can_diagnose` and `can_see_pricing` permissions
- Single interface combines diagnosis and quote creation
- Mobile mechanics can add trip fees to quotes
- Fee rules use 'independent' or 'mobile' applies_to filter
