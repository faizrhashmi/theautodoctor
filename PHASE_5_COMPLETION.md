# Phase 5: Chat-to-Video Upgrade System - COMPLETED

## Overview
Phase 5 implements the session upgrade system where customers can upgrade from a chat session to a video session mid-session by paying only the difference. This provides flexibility while maintaining fair pricing.

## Implementation Date
2025-01-27

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Base Pricing
```
Chat Session:  $15.00
Video Session: $35.00
```

### Upgrade Pricing
```
Customer books Chat:  Pays $15.00
Customer upgrades:    Pays +$20.00
─────────────────────────────────
Total paid:          $35.00

(Same as if they booked video initially)
```

**Key Principle:** Customer pays the DIFFERENCE, not the full video price.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Session Upgrade Component

**File:** `src/components/sessions/SessionUpgrade.tsx`

**Reusable Component:**
```typescript
<SessionUpgrade
  sessionId={sessionId}
  currentType="chat"
  basePriceCharge={15}
  upgradePrice={20}
  totalPrice={35}
  onUpgradeComplete={() => window.location.reload()}
/>
```

**Features:**
- **Upgrade Button:** Prominent "Upgrade to Video" button
- **Upgrade Modal:** Clear pricing breakdown
- **Benefits Display:** Why upgrade to video
- **Payment Processing:** Handles payment securely
- **Success Handling:** Notifies customer and mechanic

**UI Flow:**
```
1. Customer clicks "Upgrade to Video"
2. Modal shows:
   - Chat session (paid): $15.00
   - Upgrade fee: +$20.00
   - Total after upgrade: $35.00
3. Customer clicks "Pay $20 & Upgrade"
4. Payment processed
5. Session upgraded
6. Mechanic notified
7. Video call enabled
```

---

### 2. Payment Processing

**File:** `src/app/api/sessions/upgrade/payment/route.ts`

**POST** `/api/sessions/upgrade/payment`

**Purpose:** Process payment for session upgrade

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  session_id: string,
  upgrade_amount: number  // e.g., 20
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  payment_intent_id: string,
  upgrade_amount: number,
  message: "Payment processed successfully"
}
```

**Validations:**
- Session exists
- Session type is 'chat'
- Session not completed/cancelled
- Valid upgrade amount

**TODO in Production:**
```typescript
// Stripe payment processing
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: upgrade_amount * 100, // Convert to cents
  currency: 'usd',
  customer: stripeCustomerId,
  metadata: {
    session_id: session_id,
    upgrade_type: 'chat_to_video'
  }
})
```

---

### 3. Session Upgrade Endpoint

**File:** `src/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/upgrade/route.ts`

**PATCH** `/api/sessions/[sessionId]/upgrade`

**Purpose:** Upgrade session type after payment

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  payment_intent_id: string
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  message: "Session upgraded to video successfully",
  session: {
    id: string,
    session_type: "upgraded_from_chat",
    base_price: 15,
    upgrade_price: 20,
    total_price: 35
  }
}
```

**What It Does:**
1. Validates payment
2. Checks session eligibility
3. Updates session type to `'upgraded_from_chat'`
4. Stores upgrade_price and total_price
5. Sends notification to mechanic
6. Returns success

**Database Update:**
```sql
UPDATE diagnostic_sessions
SET
  session_type = 'upgraded_from_chat',
  upgrade_price = 20.00,
  total_price = 35.00,
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = session_id;
```

---

### 4. Pricing Utilities

**File:** `src/lib/sessions/pricing.ts`

**Constants:**
```typescript
export const SESSION_PRICES = {
  CHAT: 15.00,
  VIDEO: 35.00,
  VIDEO_UPGRADE_FEE: 20.00
}
```

**Functions:**

#### Calculate Session Price
```typescript
calculateSessionPrice('chat')
// Returns: { base_price: 15, total_price: 15 }

calculateSessionPrice('video')
// Returns: { base_price: 35, total_price: 35 }

calculateSessionPrice('upgraded_from_chat')
// Returns: { base_price: 15, upgrade_price: 20, total_price: 35 }
```

#### Calculate Upgrade Price
```typescript
calculateUpgradePrice('chat')
// Returns: { can_upgrade: true, upgrade_fee: 20, total_after_upgrade: 35 }

calculateUpgradePrice('video')
// Returns: { can_upgrade: false }
```

#### Can Upgrade Session
```typescript
canUpgradeSession('chat', 'scheduled')
// Returns: { can_upgrade: true }

canUpgradeSession('chat', 'completed')
// Returns: { can_upgrade: false, reason: 'Cannot upgrade completed session' }

canUpgradeSession('video', 'in_progress')
// Returns: { can_upgrade: false, reason: 'Only chat sessions can be upgraded' }
```

## User Flows

### Scenario 1: Customer Upgrades Before Session Starts

```
1. Customer books chat session for $15
2. Before session starts, realizes they want video
3. Clicks "Upgrade to Video" button
4. Sees pricing: Already paid $15, need to pay $20 more
5. Confirms upgrade
6. Payment processed
7. Mechanic receives notification
8. Session starts as video call
```

### Scenario 2: Customer Upgrades During Chat Session

```
1. Chat session in progress
2. Customer struggling to describe issue via text
3. Mechanic suggests: "Would video help?"
4. Customer clicks "Upgrade to Video"
5. Pays $20 upgrade fee
6. Chat room switches to video room
7. Session continues as video
8. Better diagnosis achieved
```

### Scenario 3: Customer Books Video Directly

```
1. Customer knows they need video
2. Books video session for $35
3. No upgrade needed
4. Session starts as video
```

**Result:** All paths lead to same $35 total for video session.

## Database Schema Changes

### diagnostic_sessions Table

Already has necessary fields from Phase 1:

```sql
CREATE TABLE diagnostic_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,

  -- Session type
  session_type TEXT CHECK (session_type IN (
    'chat',
    'video',
    'upgraded_from_chat',  ← New type
    'mobile_visit'
  )),

  -- Pricing
  base_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,        -- $15 for chat
  upgrade_price DECIMAL(10,2),              -- $20 if upgraded
  total_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,       -- $35 after upgrade

  -- Status
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN (
    'scheduled',
    'in_progress',
    'completed',
    'cancelled'
  )),

  -- ... other fields
);
```

**Key Field:** `session_type = 'upgraded_from_chat'`

This distinguishes upgraded sessions from direct video bookings for analytics.

## Benefits of Upgrade System

### For Customers

**1. Flexibility**
- Start with cheaper chat option
- Upgrade if needed
- No penalty for upgrading

**2. Cost Savings (Potentially)**
- Try chat first ($15)
- Only upgrade if necessary
- Save $20 if chat is sufficient

**3. Better Diagnosis**
- Can show problem visually
- Mechanic sees issue directly
- More accurate recommendations

### For Mechanics

**1. Better Communication**
- Video when needed
- Chat when sufficient
- Customer chooses based on complexity

**2. Higher Revenue**
- Some customers upgrade ($35 vs $15)
- Better diagnosis = better quotes
- More accurate service recommendations

### For Platform

**1. Customer Satisfaction**
- Flexibility increases satisfaction
- Lower barrier to entry ($15 vs $35)
- Upgrade option provides safety net

**2. Revenue Optimization**
```
Without upgrades:
- Customer unsure → Books chat ($15)
- Customer sure → Books video ($35)

With upgrades:
- Customer unsure → Books chat ($15) → Upgrades ($20) = $35
- Customer sure → Books video ($35)

Result: More customers start with chat, many upgrade = more $35 sessions
```

**3. Analytics**
```sql
-- Upgrade conversion rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE session_type = 'upgraded_from_chat') as upgrades,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE session_type = 'chat') as total_chats,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE session_type = 'upgraded_from_chat')::DECIMAL /
    NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE session_type = 'chat'), 0) * 100,
    2
  ) as upgrade_rate_percent
FROM diagnostic_sessions;
```

---

## Integration Points

### Where to Add Upgrade Button

**1. Active Chat Session Page**
```typescript
// In customer chat interface
{session.session_type === 'chat' && session.status === 'in_progress' && (
  <SessionUpgrade
    sessionId={session.id}
    currentType="chat"
    basePriceCharge={15}
    upgradePrice={20}
    totalPrice={35}
  />
)}
```

**2. Pre-Session Waiting Room**
```typescript
// Before session starts
{session.status === 'scheduled' && session.session_type === 'chat' && (
  <div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded">
    <p>Want better visual diagnosis?</p>
    <SessionUpgrade {...props} />
  </div>
)}
```

**3. Mechanic Suggestion**
```typescript
// Mechanic can send upgrade prompt
{mechanicSuggestedUpgrade && (
  <div className="bg-purple-50 p-4 rounded">
    <p>Your mechanic suggests upgrading to video for better diagnosis</p>
    <SessionUpgrade {...props} />
  </div>
)}
```

---

## Notification System

### Notify Mechanic of Upgrade

When customer upgrades, mechanic needs to know immediately.

**Real-Time Notification:**
```typescript
// Via WebSocket (recommended)
socket.emit('session_upgraded', {
  session_id: sessionId,
  customer_name: customerName,
  new_type: 'video'
})

// Mechanic receives:
socket.on('session_upgraded', (data) => {
  showNotification(
    'Session Upgraded',
    `${data.customer_name} upgraded to video call. Please enable your camera.`
  )
  // Switch UI from chat to video
  enableVideoInterface()
})
```

**Fallback Methods:**
```typescript
// SMS
await sendSMS(mechanicPhone, 'Customer upgraded to video. Enable camera.')

// Email
await sendEmail(mechanicEmail, 'Session Upgraded to Video', template)

// In-app banner
showBanner('Customer upgraded session to video')
```

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Why This Pricing Works

**1. Anchoring Effect**
```
Customer sees:
Chat: $15
Video: $35

Thinks: "I'll try chat first"

During chat:
Realizes video would help
Upgrade: +$20

Thinks: "I've already paid $15, might as well get the full experience"
```

**2. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Works in Our Favor)**
```
Customer paid $15
Issue not fully resolved via chat
Upgrade seems like "completing" the purchase
More likely to upgrade than abandon
```

**3. Fair Pricing**
```
$15 + $20 = $35
(Same as direct video booking)

Customer perceives fairness
No feeling of being "punished" for upgrading
```

---

## Analytics & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

**1. Upgrade Conversion Rate**
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE session_type = 'chat') as chat_bookings,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE session_type = 'upgraded_from_chat') as upgrades,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE session_type = 'upgraded_from_chat')::DECIMAL /
    NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE session_type = 'chat'), 0) * 100,
    2
  ) as upgrade_rate
FROM diagnostic_sessions
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**2. Revenue Per Session Type**
```sql
SELECT
  session_type,
  COUNT(*) as sessions,
  AVG(total_price) as avg_price,
  SUM(total_price) as total_revenue
FROM diagnostic_sessions
GROUP BY session_type;
```

**3. Upgrade Timing**
```sql
-- When do customers typically upgrade?
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN started_at IS NULL THEN 'Before session'
    WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (updated_at - started_at)) < 300 THEN 'Within 5 min'
    WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (updated_at - started_at)) < 900 THEN 'Within 15 min'
    ELSE 'After 15 min'
  END as upgrade_timing,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM diagnostic_sessions
WHERE session_type = 'upgraded_from_chat'
GROUP BY upgrade_timing;
```

## Production Considerations

### Payment Processing

**Stripe Integration:**
```typescript
// Production payment processing
import Stripe from 'stripe'
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!)

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: upgrade_amount * 100, // $20.00 = 2000 cents
  currency: 'usd',
  customer: stripeCustomerId,
  payment_method: savedPaymentMethod,
  off_session: true, // Can charge without customer present
  confirm: true,
  metadata: {
    session_id: session_id,
    upgrade_type: 'chat_to_video',
    original_price: '15.00',
    upgrade_price: '20.00',
    total_price: '35.00'
  }
})
```

### Video Room Transition

**Twilio Video Example:**
```typescript
// Upgrade from chat to video room
const room = await twilioClient.video.rooms.create({
  uniqueName: `session-${sessionId}`,
  type: 'peer-to-peer', // or 'group' for multi-party
  statusCallback: `${baseUrl}/api/twilio/status`,
  statusCallbackMethod: 'POST'
})

// Grant access to both customer and mechanic
const customerToken = twilioClient.tokens.create({
  identity: customerId,
  grants: new VideoGrant({
    room: room.uniqueName
  })
})

const mechanicToken = twilioClient.tokens.create({
  identity: mechanicId,
  grants: new VideoGrant({
    room: room.uniqueName
  })
})
```

### Real-Time Notifications

**WebSocket Implementation:**
```typescript
// Server-side (Socket.io)
io.to(`mechanic-${mechanicId}`).emit('session_upgraded', {
  session_id: sessionId,
  customer_name: customerName,
  upgrade_time: new Date().toISOString()
})

// Client-side (Mechanic app)
socket.on('session_upgraded', (data) => {
  showNotification({
    title: 'Session Upgraded to Video',
    message: `${data.customer_name} upgraded the session`,
    actions: [
      { label: 'Enable Camera', action: () => enableVideo() }
    ]
  })
})
```
