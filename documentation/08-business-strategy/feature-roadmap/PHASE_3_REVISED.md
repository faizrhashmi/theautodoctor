# Phase 3 REVISED: Independent Mechanics (Legally Compliant)
## Supporting Independent Mechanics Within Legal Framework

**Original Goal:** Enable independent mechanics to earn money through the platform
**Legal Challenge:** Cannot facilitate commercial repair work on residential driveways
**Solution:** Provide multiple legal pathways for independent mechanics to thrive

---

## 🎯 What We're Preserving

The core value proposition of Phase 3 remains:
- ✅ Support independent mechanics (not just workshop employees)
- ✅ Enable mechanics to build their own client base
- ✅ Flexible work arrangements
- ✅ Higher earnings potential
- ✅ Mechanic autonomy and control

**What Changes:**
- ❌ No more assuming work happens at customer's driveway
- ✅ Work must happen at legally compliant location
- ✅ Multiple pathways to comply with law

---

## 🛣️ Three Legal Pathways for Independent Mechanics

### Pathway 1: Virtual Consultation Specialist
**Target:** Independent mechanics who want flexibility without facility overhead

**What They Offer:**
- Chat diagnostics ($15 per session)
- Video diagnostics ($35 per session)
- Pre-purchase inspections (visual only)
- Second opinions
- DIY guidance
- Troubleshooting help

**Requirements:**
- ✓ Valid automotive certification (Red Seal preferred)
- ✓ Background check
- ✓ Professional liability insurance (recommended)
- ✗ NO workshop affiliation needed
- ✗ NO facility required

**Earnings Potential:**
- $12.75 per chat session (15 min avg)
- $29.75 per video session (30 min avg)
- Target: 20-40 sessions/week = $500-$1,200/week
- Work from anywhere
- Set own schedule

**Legal Status:** ✅ 100% Legal (no physical work, pure consultation)

**Example Use Cases:**
```
Customer: "Check engine light came on, what should I do?"
Mechanic (via video): "Let me see the code... that's P0420, likely catalytic
converter. Here are your options ranked by cost..."

Customer: "Is this car worth buying? Can you look at it with me?"
Mechanic (via video): "Walk around it slowly... check under the hood...
yes, I see rust on the subframe, that's a red flag..."

Customer: "I'm doing my own brake job, can you guide me?"
Mechanic (via video): "Sure! Show me your setup... okay, you need to
compress the caliper piston first, here's how..."
```

**Perfect For:**
- Retired mechanics staying active
- Mechanics building side income
- Specialists (diesel, European, performance)
- Mechanics in remote areas
- Those who want flexibility without facility costs

---

### Pathway 2: Independent Contractor with Workshop Access
**Target:** Independent mechanics who want to do physical work but don't want to be employees

**How It Works:**
1. Mechanic partners with a licensed workshop
2. Workshop provides facility access
3. Mechanic books jobs through The Auto Doctor
4. Customer brings car to workshop
5. Mechanic performs work at workshop facility
6. Revenue split between mechanic and workshop

**Partnership Models:**

**Model A: Bay Rental**
- Mechanic pays workshop $50-100 per day for bay access
- Mechanic keeps 100% of customer payments (minus platform fee)
- Workshop provides facility, insurance coverage, waste disposal
- Mechanic brings own tools (or rents workshop tools)

**Model B: Revenue Split**
- No daily fee
- Workshop takes 20-30% of labor revenue
- Workshop provides tools, equipment, facility
- Mechanic takes 70-80% of labor
- Both parties incentivized for volume

**Model C: Hybrid Membership**
- Mechanic pays $500/month membership
- Includes 10 bay-days per month
- Additional days at $40/day
- Revenue split: 80/20 on platform jobs
- Workshop provides advanced diagnostic equipment

**Requirements:**
- ✓ Valid automotive certification
- ✓ Partnership agreement with licensed workshop
- ✓ Workshop has business license, insurance, zoning
- ✓ Background check
- ✓ Workshop verification completed

**Earnings Potential:**
- Virtual consultations: $29.75 per session
- Physical repairs: $40-80/hour labor (varies by agreement)
- Parts markup: 10-20% (if workshop allows)
- Target: $1,500-$3,000/week

**Legal Status:** ✅ 100% Legal (work at licensed facility)

**Benefits for Mechanic:**
- Independence (not an employee)
- Build own client base through platform
- Flexibility in schedule
- Professional facility access
- Legal compliance and insurance
- No facility overhead

**Benefits for Workshop:**
- Additional revenue from unused bays
- Minimal management overhead
- Expands service capacity
- Network effects (more mechanics = more customers)
- Platform brings customers to them

**Example Scenario:**
```
Mechanic: John (Red Seal certified, 15 years experience)
Workshop: ABC Auto Repair (50 years in business, 6 bays)

Agreement:
- John pays ABC $300/month membership
- Includes 8 bay-days per month
- Additional days: $35/day
- John keeps 85% of labor on platform jobs
- ABC keeps 15% + facility costs covered

John's typical week:
- Monday: 3 virtual consultations from home ($90 earned)
- Tuesday: 2 repair jobs at ABC workshop ($600 earned, keeps $510)
- Wednesday: 4 virtual consultations from home ($120 earned)
- Thursday: 3 repair jobs at ABC workshop ($900 earned, keeps $765)
- Friday: Off (flexibility!)

Weekly earnings: $1,485
Monthly: ~$6,000 (working 3 days/week at facility + virtual from home)

ABC's benefit:
- Membership: $300/month
- Revenue share: ~$450/month
- Total: $750/month for minimal overhead
- Bay would otherwise sit empty
```

**Platform Features to Support This:**

1. **Workshop Marketplace**
   - List workshops offering partnership programs
   - Show terms, rates, availability
   - Filter by location, equipment, specialization
   - Reviews from other independent mechanics

2. **Bay Booking System**
   - Mechanics book specific days/times at workshop
   - Workshop sees calendar of bookings
   - Automatic scheduling to avoid conflicts
   - Integration with job bookings

3. **Revenue Split Automation**
   - Platform automatically calculates splits
   - Mechanic gets their %, workshop gets their %
   - Transparent reporting for both parties
   - Monthly statements

4. **Partnership Agreement Templates**
   - Standard contracts for each model
   - Customizable terms
   - Digital signing
   - Compliance tracking

---

### Pathway 3: Licensed Mobile Repair Company (Future - Phase 7)
**Target:** Mechanics who want to operate properly licensed mobile businesses

**What It Is:**
- NOT individual mechanics with a toolbox
- Registered business with municipal mobile repair license
- Commercial vehicle equipped for mobile work
- Proper insurance for on-site operations
- Environmental compliance equipment

**Requirements:**
- ✓ Registered business (corporation or sole proprietorship with business number)
- ✓ Municipal mobile repair license (varies by city)
- ✓ Commercial general liability insurance ($2M+)
- ✓ Commercial auto insurance for service vehicle
- ✓ Waste oil/fluid collection and disposal system
- ✓ Proper tools and equipment

- ✓ Battery replacement
- ✓ Tire changes/repairs
- ✓ Brake pad replacement (if properly equipped)
- ✓ Fluid top-ups (with proper disposal)
- ✓ Mobile diagnostics
- ✓ Accessory installation
- ✓ Minor electrical repairs

Mobile licenses typically DO NOT permit:
- ❌ Major engine work
- ❌ Transmission repairs
- ❌ Emissions testing
- ❌ Safety inspections (facility required)
- ❌ Work requiring hoist/lift
- ❌ Anything requiring specialized shop equipment

**Pricing:**
- Service call fee: $75-$150
- Labor: $100-$150/hour (premium over shop rates)
- Platform fee: 15-20%
- Minimum charge: $150

**Legal Status:** ✅ Legal (when properly licensed and compliant)

**Timeline:** Phase 7 (6-12 months post-launch)

**Why Later:**
- Requires extensive legal review per province/municipality
- Need established platform reputation first
- Complex verification process
- Start with lower-risk tiers first

### Workshop Creating Partnership Program

```
Create Partnership Program

Help independent mechanics while earning extra revenue!

Program Type:
○ Bay Rental - Charge daily/hourly rate, mechanic keeps 100% of their earnings
○ Revenue Share - No upfront fee, split revenue (recommended)
○ Membership - Monthly fee + included days + revenue share

────────────────────────────────────

Revenue Share Setup (Most Popular)

Split percentages:
Mechanic gets: [75]% (recommended: 70-85%)
Workshop gets: [25]%

Why revenue share?
✓ Attract more partners (no upfront cost)
✓ Aligned incentives (more volume = more revenue)
✓ Platform brings customers to your facility
✓ Fill unused bays

Example earnings:
If mechanic does $10,000/month in labor:
→ Mechanic gets: $7,500
→ You get: $2,500 (for facility access only)
→ Win-win!
