# Phase 3: Independent Mechanic Flow - COMPLETED

## Overview
Phase 3 implements the quote flow for independent and mobile mechanics who perform BOTH diagnosis AND quote creation in a single workflow. Unlike workshop mechanics (Phase 2), independent mechanics see pricing and control their own quotes.

## Implementation Date
2025-01-27

## What Was Built

### 1. Combined Diagnosis + Quote Interface

**File:** `src/app/mechanic/sessions/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx`

**Key Difference from Workshop Flow:**
- **Workshop**: Mechanic diagnoses (NO PRICING) → Service Advisor creates quote (WITH PRICING)
- **Independent**: Mechanic does BOTH in one screen (WITH PRICING)

**Features:**

#### Section 1: Diagnosis Documentation
- Diagnosis summary (required)
- Detailed findings (optional list)
- Recommended services (required list)
- Urgency level (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Service type categorization
- Photo upload capability

#### Section 2: Quote Creation
- **Mobile/Trip Fee Toggle**
  - Checkbox to mark as mobile visit
  - Distance input (km)
  - Trip fee amount
- **Line Items**
  - Labor items (hours × rate)
  - Parts items (quantity × unit cost × in_stock)
  - Add/remove items dynamically
- **Real-time Fee Calculation**
  - Platform fee automatically calculated
  - Shows customer total
  - Shows amount mechanic receives
- **Additional Details**
  - Notes for customer
  - Estimated completion time
  - Warranty period (default 90 days)

**Pricing Visibility:**
```
✓ Independent mechanics SEE all pricing
✓ Can set their own labor rates
✓ Can set their own parts costs
✓ See exactly what they'll receive after platform fees
```

### 2. API Endpoint for Independent Mechanics

**File:** `src/app/api/mechanic/sessions/complete/route.ts`

**POST** `/api/mechanic/sessions/complete`

**What It Does:**
1. Validates session and mechanic
2. Ensures mechanic is independent (not workshop)
3. Updates diagnostic session with diagnosis
4. Creates repair quote with pricing
5. If mobile visit, creates in_person_visit record with trip fee
6. Links quote to diagnostic session
7. Sends notification to customer

**Request Body:**
```typescript
{
  session_id: string,
  diagnosis: {
    summary: string,
    findings: string[],
    recommended_services: string[],
    urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent',
    service_type: string,
    photos: string[]
  },
  quote: {
    line_items: LineItem[],
    labor_cost: number,
    parts_cost: number,
    subtotal: number,
    trip_fee?: number,        // For mobile mechanics
    trip_distance?: number,   // For mobile mechanics
    platform_fee_percent: number,
    platform_fee_amount: number,
    customer_total: number,
    provider_receives: number,
    fee_rule_applied: string,
    notes?: string,
    estimated_completion_hours?: number,
    warranty_days?: number
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  quote_id: string,
  message: "Diagnosis completed and quote sent successfully"
}
```

### 3. Mobile Mechanic Trip Fee Support

**Database:**
Uses existing `in_person_visits` table with:
- `visit_type: 'mobile_visit'`
- `trip_fee: number`
- `customer_location: string`

**Fee Calculation:**
```
Subtotal = Labor + Parts
Total Before Fees = Subtotal + Trip Fee
Platform Fee = Total Before Fees × Fee Percent
Customer Total = Total Before Fees + Platform Fee
Provider Receives = Total Before Fees
```

**Example:**
```
Labor: $150
Parts: $200
Trip Fee: $50
─────────────
Subtotal: $400
Platform Fee (12%): $54
─────────────
Customer Pays: $454
You Receive: $400
```

### 4. Mechanic Dashboard

**File:** `src/app/mechanic/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Stats overview (sessions, quotes, revenue)
- Pending sessions list
- Active quotes list
- Quick links to complete sessions
- Notification system for success messages

**Stats Displayed:**
- Pending Sessions
- Active Quotes
- Approved Today
- Revenue This Month

## Fee Calculation for Independent Mechanics

### Fee Rules Applied

Independent mechanics use the same fee rules as workshops with `applies_to: 'all'` or `applies_to: 'independent'`.

Mobile mechanics can have specific rules with `applies_to: 'mobile'`.

**Default Rules:**
```sql
-- Standard independent fee (12%)
INSERT INTO platform_fee_rules (
  rule_name,
  rule_type,
  applies_to,
  fee_percentage,
  priority,
  description
) VALUES (
  'Standard Independent Fee',
  'percentage',
  'independent',
  12.00,
  0,
  'Default 12% fee for independent mechanics'
);

-- Mobile mechanic could have tiered fees
INSERT INTO platform_fee_rules (
  rule_name,
  rule_type,
  applies_to,
  tiers,
  priority,
  description
) VALUES (
  'Mobile Mechanic Tiered Fee',
  'tiered',
  'mobile',
  '[
    {"max_value": 100, "fee_percent": 15},
    {"max_value": 500, "fee_percent": 12},
    {"max_value": null, "fee_percent": 10}
  ]',
  5,
  'Tiered fees for mobile mechanics'
);
```

**Tiered Fee Example:**
- Jobs under $100: 15% fee
- Jobs $100-$500: 12% fee
- Jobs over $500: 10% fee

This incentivizes larger jobs while ensuring platform revenue on smaller jobs.

## Mobile Mechanic Workflow

### Special Considerations for Mobile Mechanics

**1. Trip Fees**
- Mobile mechanics can charge for travel to customer location
- Trip fee added to subtotal before platform fee calculation
- Distance tracked for analytics

**2. Parts Availability**
- Mobile mechanics track if parts are `in_stock`
- If not in stock, may require second trip
- Customer informed of multi-trip scenarios

**3. Location Tracking**
- `in_person_visits` table stores:
  - `customer_location` (address)
  - `customer_coordinates` (POINT)
  - `trip_fee`
  - `status` (scheduled, en_route, arrived, completed)

**4. Visit Status Tracking**
```
scheduled → en_route → arrived → in_progress → completed
```

---

## Complete Independent Mechanic Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Customer Books Diagnostic Session**
   - Via chat, video, or requests in-person visit
   - Describes vehicle issue
   - Pays for diagnostic session

2. **Mechanic Accepts Session**
   - Reviews customer request
   - Accepts session
   - Schedules time

3. **Mechanic Performs Diagnosis**
   - Completes diagnostic (chat/video/in-person)
   - Documents findings
   - Identifies recommended services

4. **Mechanic Creates Quote (SAME SCREEN)**
   - Adds labor line items with rates
   - Adds parts line items with costs
   - If mobile: adds trip fee
   - Sees platform fee calculation in real-time
   - Sees exactly what they'll receive
   - Adds warranty and estimated completion
   - Sends quote to customer

5. **Customer Reviews Quote**
   - Receives notification
   - Views quote details online
   - Reviews diagnosis and pricing
   - Makes decision:
     - **Approve** → Proceeds to payment
     - **Decline** → Provides reason
     - **Request Changes** → Mechanic can modify

6. **Quote Approved**
   - Payment collected via escrow
   - Mechanic notified to begin work
   - Work tracked in system
   - Upon completion, escrow released to mechanic

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Records Created

**For Each Completed Session:**

1. **diagnostic_sessions** - Updated with diagnosis
```sql
UPDATE diagnostic_sessions SET
  status = 'completed',
  diagnosis_summary = '...',
  recommended_services = ARRAY['...'],
  urgency = 'medium',
  service_type = 'brakes',
  quote_sent = true,
  quote_id = '...'
WHERE id = session_id;
```

2. **repair_quotes** - Created with full quote
```sql
INSERT INTO repair_quotes (
  customer_id,
  mechanic_id,      -- Independent mechanic ID
  workshop_id,      -- NULL for independent
  diagnosing_mechanic_id,  -- Same as mechanic_id
  quoting_user_id,  -- Same as mechanic_id
  line_items,
  labor_cost,
  parts_cost,
  subtotal,
  platform_fee_percent,
  platform_fee_amount,
  customer_total,
  provider_receives,
  ...
) VALUES (...);
```

3. **in_person_visits** - Created if mobile visit
```sql
INSERT INTO in_person_visits (
  customer_id,
  mechanic_id,
  visit_type = 'mobile_visit',
  trip_fee,
  status = 'scheduled',
  quote_id
) VALUES (...);
```

### Permission Checks

**Independent Mechanic Permissions:**
```typescript
{
  can_diagnose: true,
  can_send_quotes: true,
  can_see_pricing: true,
  can_manage_mechanics: false,  // Independent operator
  can_view_analytics: true,     // Own analytics
  can_manage_settings: true     // Own settings
}
```

**Validation in API:**
```typescript
// Ensure not a workshop mechanic
if (session.workshop_id) {
  return error('Workshop mechanics should use workshop flow')
}

// Independent mechanics process their own quotes
mechanic_id === diagnosing_mechanic_id === quoting_user_id
```

---

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/app/mechanic/sessions/[sessionId]/complete/page.tsx` (Combined diagnosis + quote interface)
- `src/app/api/mechanic/sessions/complete/route.ts` (API endpoint for independent mechanics)
- `src/app/mechanic/dashboard/page.tsx` (Mechanic dashboard)

### Existing Files (No Changes)
All Phase 2 files remain unchanged. Phase 3 adds parallel functionality for independent mechanics without modifying workshop flow.

## User Experience Comparison

### Workshop Mechanic Experience
```
1. Open diagnostic session
2. Document findings (no pricing)
3. Submit to service advisor
4. [Wait for service advisor to create quote]
5. Service advisor creates quote
6. Customer receives quote
```

### Independent Mechanic Experience
```
1. Open diagnostic session
2. Document findings
3. Add line items with pricing (same screen)
4. See real-time fee calculation
5. Send quote to customer
6. [No waiting - done!]
```

**Time Savings:** Independent mechanics complete entire process in one screen, reducing time and improving efficiency.

## Mobile Mechanic Specific Features

### Trip Fee Calculator

```typescript
function calculateTripFee(distance_km: number): number {
  // Example: $1.50 per km, minimum $20
  const perKm = 1.50
  const minimum = 20

  const calculated = distance_km * perKm
  return Math.max(calculated, minimum)
}
```

### Parts Stock Tracking

```typescript
interface PartsLineItem {
  description: string
  quantity: number
  unit_cost: number
  in_stock: boolean  // ← Important for mobile mechanics
}

// If parts not in stock:
// 1. Customer notified of delay
// 2. Mechanic orders parts
// 3. Second visit scheduled
// 4. Additional trip fee may apply
```

### Mobile Visit Lifecycle

```sql
-- Initial visit for diagnosis
INSERT INTO in_person_visits (
  visit_type = 'mobile_visit',
  status = 'scheduled'
);

-- Update as mechanic travels
UPDATE in_person_visits SET status = 'en_route';

-- Update on arrival
UPDATE in_person_visits SET
  status = 'arrived',
  arrived_at = NOW();

-- Start work
UPDATE in_person_visits SET status = 'in_progress';

-- Complete work
UPDATE in_person_visits SET
  status = 'completed',
  completed_at = NOW();
```
