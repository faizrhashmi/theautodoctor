## 🚨 RISKS & BLOCKERS

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Schema Changes**: Document management requires new fields/tables
2. **API Development**: Some features need new backend endpoints
3. **Stripe Integration**: Earnings dashboard relies on accurate Stripe data
4. **File Storage**: Document storage costs may increase

### Business Risks
1. **Mechanic Adoption**: New features need training/onboarding
2. **Data Migration**: Existing mechanics may have incomplete data
3. **Compliance**: SIN collection has legal requirements
4. **Support Load**: New features = new support questions initially

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Phased Rollout**: Release Phase 1 to beta mechanics first
- **Training Materials**: Create video tutorials for each feature
- **Gradual Enforcement**: SIN collection required but with grace period
- **Proactive Communication**: Announce features in advance

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. **Review & Approve** this analysis
2. **Prioritize** phases based on business needs
3. **Assign** development resources
4. **Create** detailed technical specs for Phase 1
5. **Begin** implementation with Earnings Dashboard
6. **Test** thoroughly with beta mechanic group

## 📞 QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY

1. **Earnings Priority:** How urgent is earnings transparency? (Affects Phase 1 priority)
2. **Document Compliance:** Are expired documents a legal/insurance risk?
3. **SIN Collection:** Is this blocking payouts currently?
4. **Budget:** What's the approved budget for mechanic improvements?
5. **Timeline:** What's the deadline for critical features?
6. **Beta Testing:** Can we test with a small group of mechanics first?
