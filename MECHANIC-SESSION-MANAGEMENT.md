# Mechanic Session Management - Best Practices Implementation

## Overview

The mechanic dashboard now implements **industry best-practice session management** inspired by platforms like Uber, DoorDash, and TaskRabbit. The system ensures mechanics cannot "escape" their commitments and provides full accountability across logout/login cycles.

---

## 📊 Clear Definitions

### 1. **Pending Requests** (Orange Badge)
```
Status: Unclaimed
Who can see: ALL mechanics
What it means: Customer requests waiting for ANY mechanic to claim
Database: session_requests WHERE status='pending' AND mechanic_id IS NULL
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🟠 Orange color scheme
- "X unclaimed" badge
- Label: "Available for ANY mechanic to claim"

### 2. **My Active Work** (Green Badge)
```
Status: Assigned to YOU
Who can see: Only the assigned mechanic
What it means: Sessions YOU are responsible for (waiting OR live)
Database: sessions WHERE mechanic_id=YOUR_ID AND status IN ('waiting', 'live')
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🟢 Green color scheme
- Shows breakdown: "X Live • Y Waiting"
- **Persists across logout/login** - Cannot disappear

### Session States Within "My Active Work":
- **⏳ Waiting to Start** (Amber badge): Accepted but not started yet
- **🔴 Live Now** (Red badge): Session is currently in progress

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Sessions Table as Source of Truth**

**OLD APPROACH (Broken):**
```typescript
// ❌ Queried session_requests table
// Problem: Disappeared after logout because request status changed
fetchActiveSessions() {
  query session_requests WHERE status='accepted' AND mechanic_id=X
}
```

**NEW APPROACH (Robust):**
```typescript
// ✅ Queries sessions table directly
// Solution: Always visible because sessions persist
fetchActiveSessions() {
  query sessions WHERE mechanic_id=X AND status IN ('waiting', 'live')
}
```

### 2. **Persistence Across Sessions**

| Event | OLD Behavior | NEW Behavior |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Accept request | Shows in dashboard | Shows in dashboard ✓ |
| Logout | **DISAPPEARS** ❌ | **STILL VISIBLE** ✓ |
| Login again | Gone forever ❌ | Immediately appears ✓ |
| Try to accept new request | Blocked (confused why) | Blocked **with clear explanation** ✓ |

### 3. **Crystal Clear Messaging**

**Dashboard Header:**
```
⚡ MY ACTIVE WORK: 1
Sessions assigned to you (persists across logout/login)
```

**Info Box:**
```
💡 How It Works: Sessions assigned to you remain here even after logout/login.
Click "Start Session" to begin work, or "Cancel / Unlock" to release back to all mechanics.
You must complete or cancel before accepting new requests.
```

**Blocking Message:**
```
🔒 You have 1 active session assigned to you

Complete or cancel your current work before accepting new requests.
Your active sessions persist even if you logout/login - they're your responsibility.

↑ Scroll up to "MY ACTIVE WORK" section or use "Force End All" if stuck
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```
1. Customer creates request
   └─> session_requests: status='pending', mechanic_id=NULL

2. Mechanic accepts request
   ├─> session_requests: status='accepted', mechanic_id=MECHANIC_ID
   └─> sessions: created, status='waiting', mechanic_id=MECHANIC_ID

3. Mechanic logs out
   └─> Sessions remain in database (mechanic_id unchanged)

4. Mechanic logs in
   └─> Dashboard queries: sessions WHERE mechanic_id=X AND status IN ('waiting', 'live')
   └─> ✅ Active sessions IMMEDIATELY visible
```

### Key Code Changes

**File:** `src/app/mechanic/dashboard/MechanicDashboardClient.tsx`

**Lines 230-316:** New `fetchActiveSessions()` function
```typescript
// Query sessions table directly - source of truth
const { data: sessions } = await supabase
  .from('sessions')
  .select('id, status, type, plan, customer_user_id, created_at, started_at, metadata, intake_id')
  .eq('mechanic_id', mechanicId)
  .in('status', ['waiting', 'live']) // Both waiting and in-progress
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })

// Enrich with customer info, intake data, files
// Returns sessions with isLive flag for visual distinction
```

**Lines 1036-1060:** Updated stats cards
- "Pending Requests" with subtitle "Available for all mechanics"
- "My Active Work" with subtitle "Waiting + In Progress"

**Lines 1095-1141:** Enhanced active work banner
- Title: "MY ACTIVE WORK: X"
- Subtitle: "Sessions assigned to you (persists across logout/login)"
- Shows breakdown: "X Live • Y Waiting"

**Lines 1153-1165:** State-specific badges
- 🔴 Red "Live Now" for sessions.status='live'
- ⏳ Amber "Waiting to Start" for sessions.status='waiting'

## 🚀 Benefits & Best Practices

### 1. **Accountability**
- Mechanics cannot "lose track" of sessions by logging out
- Active work follows them until completed/cancelled
- Matches real-world expectations (Uber driver can't abandon a ride)

### 2. **Consistency**
- Sessions table is single source of truth
- No synchronization issues between session_requests and sessions
- State is always accurate

### 3. **User Experience**
- Crystal clear what "pending" vs "my work" means
- Visual distinction between "waiting" and "live"
- Helpful tips explain the system
- Emergency "Force End All" for stuck sessions

### 4. **One Session At A Time Rule**
- Clearly enforced with helpful messaging
- Mechanic understands WHY they're blocked
- Knows exactly WHERE to find their active work
- Has tools to resolve (complete/cancel/force-end)

## 🎓 Comparison to Industry Standards

| Platform | Mechanic Platform | Implementation |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Uber** | Driver can't accept new ride while on trip | ✓ One session at a time |
| **DoorDash** | Dasher sees "Active Order" after app restart | ✓ Persists across login |
| **TaskRabbit** | Tasker must complete/cancel before new task | ✓ Must finish current work |
| **Instacart** | Shopper sees committed batch on re-login | ✓ Sessions follow mechanic |

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Accept a request → verify appears in "My Active Work"
- [ ] Logout → login → verify session STILL in "My Active Work"
- [ ] Try to accept new request → verify blocked with clear message
- [ ] Start session → verify badge changes to "🔴 Live Now"
- [ ] Complete session → verify can now accept new requests
- [ ] Cancel session → verify returns to pending for all mechanics
- [ ] Force End All → verify emergency escape works
- [ ] Refresh button → verify manually fetches latest data
- [ ] Auto-refresh → verify updates every 60s automatically

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "I accepted a request but don't see it"
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or click Refresh button

### Issue: "I'm blocked but don't see any sessions"
**Check:**
1. Scroll up to "MY ACTIVE WORK" section (might be above viewport)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Use "Force End All" if truly stuck
4. Verify database: `SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE mechanic_id='YOUR_ID' AND status IN ('waiting', 'live')`

### Issue: "Session shows after I completed it"
**Likely cause:** Frontend state out of sync
**Solution:** Click Refresh button (auto-refresh will fix in 60s)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Push Notifications:** Alert mechanic when they have forgotten active work
2. **Session Timeout:** Auto-cancel waiting sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity
3. **Multi-Session Support:** Allow experienced mechanics to handle 2-3 concurrent sessions
4. **Session Handoff:** Transfer session to another mechanic if needed
5. **Performance Metrics:** Track average time from accept → start → complete
