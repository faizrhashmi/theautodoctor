# 🎉 Phase 2: Data Collection - COMPLETE

**Date Completed:** 2025-01-25
**Implementation Time:** Session continued from Phase 1
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Phase 3 (Dashboards)

---

## 📊 Phase 2 Summary: Data Collection & Aggregation

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Metrics Aggregation System**

#### **1. Metrics Service** ([`workshopMetrics.ts`](src/lib/analytics/workshopMetrics.ts))

**Features Implemented:**
- **Daily Metrics Calculation** - Aggregates all events from previous day
- **Weekly Metrics Calculation** - Rolls up daily metrics into weekly summaries
- **Alert Trigger Logic** - Automatically creates alerts based on metric thresholds
- **Query Functions** - Get metrics for date ranges and latest snapshot

**Metrics Calculated (Daily):**
```typescript
// Funnel Metrics
- signups_started, signups_completed, signups_failed
- signup_conversion_rate (target: >60%)

// Approval Metrics
- applications_pending, applications_approved, applications_rejected
- avg_approval_time_hours (target: <24h)
- median_approval_time_hours

// Invitation Metrics
- invites_sent, invites_accepted, invites_expired
- invite_acceptance_rate (target: >70%)

// Email Metrics
- emails_sent, emails_failed
- email_success_rate (target: >98%)
- Breakdown by type (approval/rejection/invite)

// Workshop Health
- active_workshops, pending_workshops, suspended_workshops
- workshops_with_mechanics
- total_mechanics_active
- avg_mechanics_per_workshop

// Activity Metrics
- dashboard_logins, profile_updates
- api_errors, api_success_rate
```

**Alert Thresholds Implemented:**
- 📊 Signup conversion < 30% → Warning alert
- 📧 Email success < 95% → Warning (< 80% → Critical)
- ⏱️ Approval time > 36 hours → Warning alert
- 📦 Applications pending > 5 → Backlog alert
- 🎯 Beta milestone (3-5 workshops) → Info alert

---

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Cron Job System**

#### **2. Metrics Aggregation Cron** ([`/api/cron/workshop-metrics`](src/app/api/cron/workshop-metrics/route.ts))

**Features:**
- **GET Endpoint** - For scheduled cron execution
- **POST Endpoint** - For manual triggering with parameters
- **Backfill Support** - Can calculate metrics for date ranges
- **Flexible Scheduling** - Daily (default) or weekly metrics

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Daily metrics (automated)
GET /api/cron/workshop-metrics

# Calculate for specific date
GET /api/cron/workshop-metrics?date=2025-01-24

# Backfill date range
POST /api/cron/workshop-metrics
{
  "startDate": "2025-01-01",
  "endDate": "2025-01-24",
  "backfill": true
}
```

#### **3. Alert Monitoring Cron** ([`/api/cron/workshop-alerts`](src/app/api/cron/workshop-alerts/route.ts))

**Alert Checks Implemented:**
- ✅ **Application Stuck** - Pending > 48 hours
- ✅ **Approval Backlog** - > 5 pending applications
- ✅ **Workshop Inactive** - No dashboard access in 14 days
- ✅ **Expired Invitations** - Marks as expired, tracks event
- ✅ **Low Invite Acceptance** - < 50% acceptance rate

**Manual Trigger Options:**
```bash
# Run all checks
GET /api/cron/workshop-alerts

# Run specific check
POST /api/cron/workshop-alerts
{
  "checkType": "stuck_applications" | "inactive_workshops" | "expired_invitations"
}
```

---

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Additional Event Tracking**

#### **4. Mechanic Signup Tracking** ([`workshop-signup/route.ts`](src/app/api/mechanic/workshop-signup/route.ts))

**Events Now Tracked:**
- ✅ `mechanic_invite_accepted` - When mechanic completes signup
- Includes workshop ID, mechanic name, auto-approval status
- Links mechanic to workshop for tracking

**Workshop Mechanic Features:**
- Auto-approved (no admin review needed)
- SIN-exempt (workshop handles taxes)
- Simplified onboarding process

---

### ✅ **COMPLETED: Supabase Cron Configuration**

#### **5. Database Cron Jobs** ([`20250125_workshop_cron_jobs.sql`](supabase/migrations/20250125_workshop_cron_jobs.sql))

**Three Automated Jobs Created:**

| Job Name | Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `workshop-daily-metrics` | Daily 1 AM UTC | Calculate yesterday's metrics |
| `workshop-hourly-alerts` | Every hour | Check for issues and create alerts |
| `workshop-weekly-metrics` | Monday 2 AM UTC | Aggregate weekly metrics |

**Features:**
- Pure SQL implementation (runs in database)
- No external dependencies
- Automatic conflict resolution (upsert)
- Efficient aggregation queries

## 📈 What's Now Automated

### **Daily (1 AM UTC)**
- All events from previous day aggregated
- KPIs calculated and stored
- Conversion rates computed
- Alert thresholds checked
- Metrics saved to `workshop_metrics` table

### **Hourly**
- Applications stuck > 48 hours flagged
- Approval backlogs detected
- Inactive workshops identified
- Expired invitations marked
- Alerts created in `workshop_alerts` table

### **Weekly (Mondays 2 AM UTC)**
- Weekly rollup of daily metrics
- Trend analysis data prepared
- Long-term KPIs calculated

---

## 🧪 Testing Phase 2

### **Test Metrics Aggregation:**

```bash
# Trigger daily metrics manually
curl http://localhost:3001/api/cron/workshop-metrics

# Check metrics were saved
SELECT * FROM workshop_metrics
WHERE metric_type = 'daily'
ORDER BY metric_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### **Test Alert System:**

```bash
# Trigger alert checks
curl http://localhost:3001/api/cron/workshop-alerts

# Check alerts created
SELECT * FROM workshop_alerts
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### **Test Event Tracking:**

1. Create a workshop signup
2. Admin approve/reject
3. Invite a mechanic
4. Check events table:

```sql
SELECT event_type, event_category, created_at, success
FROM workshop_events
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

---

## 📦 Migration Instructions

### **Apply Both Migrations:**

1. **Analytics Tables** (if not already applied)
   ```sql
   -- Run: supabase/migrations/20250125_workshop_analytics_tables.sql
   ```

2. **Cron Jobs** (new)
   ```sql
   -- Run: supabase/migrations/20250125_workshop_cron_jobs.sql
   ```

### **Enable pg_cron Extension:**

In Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
```

### **Verify Cron Jobs:**

```sql
-- View scheduled jobs
SELECT * FROM cron.job;

-- View recent job runs
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### **Design Decisions:**

1. **SQL-Based Cron** - Runs in database, no external dependencies
2. **Upsert Pattern** - Idempotent operations, can re-run safely
3. **Hourly Alerts** - Balance between responsiveness and efficiency
4. **Daily Metrics** - Sufficient granularity for business needs
5. **Event-Driven** - Metrics derived from events, single source of truth

### **Error Handling:**

- Non-blocking tracking (failures don't break main flow)
- Graceful degradation (missing metrics don't crash dashboards)
- Alert deduplication (prevents spam)
- Auto-resolution (clears resolved issues)

---

## 🏆 Phase 2 Metrics

- ✅ **3 service modules** created (metrics, 2 cron endpoints)
- ✅ **3 database cron jobs** configured
- ✅ **20+ metrics** calculated daily
- ✅ **5+ alert rules** checking hourly
- ✅ **100% automated** data collection
- ✅ **Zero manual intervention** required

---

## 📅 Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
1. Apply cron jobs migration to Supabase
2. Enable pg_cron extension
3. Test metrics calculation manually
4. Verify alerts are created

### **Phase 3 Preview:**
When ready, say **"Let's do Phase 3"** to build:
- Admin analytics dashboard
- Workshop health scorecard
- Beta program tracker
- Real-time metrics display
