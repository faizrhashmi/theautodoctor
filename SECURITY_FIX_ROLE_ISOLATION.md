# CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: Role Isolation in Chat System

## üö® The Security Flaw

### What Was Wrong

When testing on the **same browser**, users could be logged in as BOTH:
1. **Customer** (via Supabase authentication)
2. **Mechanic** (via custom `aad_mech` cookie)

The old code prioritized role detection based on **cookie presence** instead of **session assignment**:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (INSECURE):
const currentUserId = user?.id || mechanic?.id
const userRole = mechanic ? 'mechanic' : 'customer'  // ‚ùå WRONG!
```

This meant:
- If `mechanic` cookie exists ‚Üí **Always treated as mechanic**
- Even if the session was created by them as a customer!

### The Impact

**Scenario**: User creates a customer session, then logs in as mechanic on same browser

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Customer session loads correctly
- ‚ùå Role detected as "mechanic" (wrong!)
- ‚ùå "Dashboard" button redirects to `/mechanic/dashboard`
- ‚ùå Customer trying to return to their dashboard gets sent to mechanic dashboard
- üö® **Complete role confusion and potential security breach**

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### New Role Detection Logic

```typescript
// NEW CODE (SECURE):
// 1. Fetch session FIRST
const session = await supabase.from('sessions').select(...).eq('id', sessionId).single()

// 2. Check if they are the assigned mechanic for THIS SPECIFIC SESSION
const isMechanicForThisSession = mechanic && session.mechanic_id === mechanic.id

// 3. Check if they are the customer who created THIS SPECIFIC SESSION
const isCustomerForThisSession = user && session.customer_user_id === user.id

// 4. Assign role based on session assignment
if (isMechanicForThisSession) {
  userRole = 'mechanic'
} else if (isCustomerForThisSession) {
  userRole = 'customer'
} else {
  // Access denied - not authorized for this session
  notFound()
}
```

### Key Security Improvements

1. **Session-Based Role Assignment** ‚úÖ
   - Role is determined by the session's `customer_user_id` and `mechanic_id` fields
   - Not by which cookies happen to exist

2. **Proper Access Control** ‚úÖ
   - Customers can ONLY access sessions they created (`customer_user_id` matches)
   - Mechanics can ONLY access sessions they're assigned to (`mechanic_id` matches)
   - Anyone else gets 404

3. **No Cross-Role Access** ‚úÖ
   - Even if both cookies exist, only the relevant role for that session is used
   - Complete isolation between customer and mechanic contexts

4. **Security Logging** ‚úÖ
   - Server logs show role detection process
   - Easy to debug and audit access

## üß™ How to Verify the Fix

### Test 1: Customer Accessing Their Own Session

**Setup**:
1. Log in as customer
2. Create/join a chat session

**Expected**:
```
[CHAT PAGE SECURITY] Role assigned: CUSTOMER
```

**Verify**:
- Header shows customer view
- "Dashboard" button ‚Üí `/customer/dashboard`
- Can send messages as customer

### Test 2: Mechanic Accessing Assigned Session

**Setup**:
1. Log in as mechanic
2. Accept a customer's session request

**Expected**:
```
[CHAT PAGE SECURITY] Role assigned: MECHANIC
```

**Verify**:
- Header shows mechanic view
- "Dashboard" button ‚Üí `/mechanic/dashboard`
- Can send messages as mechanic

### Test 3: Both Cookies Present (The Critical Test)

**Setup**:
1. In same browser, log in as customer
2. Create a chat session (note the session ID)
3. In SAME browser, log in as mechanic
4. Try to access the customer's session URL

**Expected**:
```
[CHAT PAGE SECURITY] {
  hasUserAuth: true,
  hasMechanicAuth: true,
  isMechanicForThisSession: false,
  isCustomerForThisSession: true
}
[CHAT PAGE SECURITY] Role assigned: CUSTOMER  ‚úÖ CORRECT!
```

**Verify**:
- Should see customer view (not mechanic)
- "Dashboard" button ‚Üí `/customer/dashboard` (correct!)

### Test 4: Unauthorized Access Attempt

**Setup**:
1. Log in as mechanic A
2. Try to access a session assigned to mechanic B

**Expected**:
```
[CHAT PAGE SECURITY] ACCESS DENIED - Not assigned to this session
‚Üí 404 Page Not Found
```

## üìã Security Checklist

- [x] Role determined by session assignment, not cookie presence
- [x] Customers can only access their own sessions
- [x] Mechanics can only access assigned sessions
- [x] Proper 404 for unauthorized access
- [x] All dashboard links use `isMechanic` variable (no hardcoded URLs)
- [x] Security logging for audit trail
- [x] No cross-role data leakage

## üîç Monitoring

Check server console logs for role detection:

```
[CHAT PAGE SECURITY] {
  sessionId: "abc-123",
  hasUserAuth: true,
  hasMechanicAuth: true,
  sessionCustomerId: "customer-id",
  sessionMechanicId: "mechanic-id",
  isMechanicForThisSession: false,
  isCustomerForThisSession: true
}
[CHAT PAGE SECURITY] Role assigned: CUSTOMER
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with both roles on same browser
2. **Monitor logs** for any unexpected role assignments
3. **Consider** implementing a warning banner when both cookies are present
4. **Future enhancement**: Implement a "Switch Role" feature for admin testing

## üìù Files Modified

1. **`src/app/chat/[id]/page.tsx`**
   - Fixed role detection logic (lines 73-109)
   - Added security logging
   - Added proper access control

2. **`src/app/chat/[id]/ChatRoomV3.tsx`**
   - Already had correct dashboard links using `isMechanic`
   - No hardcoded URLs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **For Development/Testing**: When testing on the same browser, you may have both cookies. The system now correctly handles this.
- **For Production**: Users will typically only have one set of credentials, but the fix ensures proper isolation even if both exist.
- **Cookie Clearing**: If you want to test pure customer/mechanic access, use incognito mode or clear cookies between tests.

**Security Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Role isolation now properly enforced based on session assignment.
