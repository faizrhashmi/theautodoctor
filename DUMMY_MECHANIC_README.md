## Business Model Notes

### Your B2B2C Model
This setup supports your business model where:

1. **Workshops (B2B):**
   - Elite Auto Care Workshop is the business customer
   - They employ/affiliate mechanics
   - They earn commission on sessions (12%)
   - They can serve customers in their service radius

2. **Mechanics (B):**
   - Alex Thompson works for the workshop
   - Can perform both virtual and physical work
   - Affiliated with workshop but can also work independently
   - Shares earnings with workshop per commission structure

3. **End Customers (C):**
   - Can request services from workshop-affiliated mechanics
   - Can choose virtual or physical services
   - Benefit from workshop's reputation and oversight

### Physical Work Capability ‚úÖ
**Key Configuration:**
- `can_perform_physical_work: true`
- `prefers_physical: true`
- `participation_mode: both` (can do virtual AND physical)
- `shop_affiliation: dealership` (has physical location)
- `workshop_id` is set (affiliated with workshop)

This means Alex can:
- Accept virtual diagnostic sessions
- Accept physical repair work at the workshop
- Travel to customer locations (if mobile services enabled)
- Work on-site at the workshop facility

## Scripts for Management

### Create/Recreate Dummy Data (Supabase Auth)
```bash
node scripts/create-dummy-mechanic-supabase-auth.js
```
This creates:
- ‚úÖ Supabase Auth user in `auth.users`
- ‚úÖ Profile with `role='mechanic'`
- ‚úÖ Mechanic record linked via `user_id`

### Verify Supabase Auth Integration
```bash
node scripts/verify-supabase-auth-integration.js
```
This verifies:
- ‚úÖ Auth user exists
- ‚úÖ Profile linked correctly
- ‚úÖ Mechanic has `user_id`
- ‚úÖ Login works
- ‚úÖ RLS policies compatible

### Legacy Script (Old Auth - Don't Use)
```bash
node scripts/create-dummy-mechanic.js  # Uses password_hash - deprecated
```

### Other Utility Scripts
```bash
node scripts/verify-dummy-mechanic.js
node scripts/check-mechanics-schema.js
node scripts/check-existing-mechanics.js
```

## Database Records

### Auth Users Table (Supabase Auth)
- User ID: `8019ea82-9eb3-4df8-b97a-3079d589fe7a`
- Table: `auth.users`
- Email: `workshop.mechanic@test.com`
- Password: `1234`

- Table: `public.profiles`
- Role: `mechanic`
- Account Type: `individual_customer`

### Mechanics Table
- Mechanic ID: `c62837da-8ff1-4218-afbe-3da2e940dfd7`
- User ID: `8019ea82-9eb3-4df8-b97a-3079d589fe7a` ‚úÖ **LINKED TO AUTH**

```
auth.users (8019ea82...)
    ‚Üì (id)
profiles (8019ea82...)
    ‚Üì (role=mechanic)

## Important Database Constraints

Based on the database schema, here are the constraints to be aware of:

### Account Type
- **Valid Values:** `individual_mechanic`, `workshop_mechanic`
- Note: NOT `independent` or `workshop` (older migration not yet applied)

### Shop Affiliation
- **Valid Values:** `independent`, `dealership`, `franchise`, `mobile`
- Note: NOT `workshop`

## Troubleshooting

### If Login Fails

This mechanic uses **Supabase Auth**. If you see login issues:

1. **Verify auth user exists:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-supabase-auth-integration.js
   ```

2. **Check linkages manually:**
   ```sql
   -- Check auth user
   SELECT id, email, email_confirmed_at
   FROM auth.users
   WHERE email = 'workshop.mechanic@test.com';

   -- Check profile
   SELECT id, role, account_type
   FROM profiles
   WHERE email = 'workshop.mechanic@test.com';

   -- Check mechanic linkage
   SELECT id, user_id, email, can_accept_sessions
   FROM mechanics
   WHERE email = 'workshop.mechanic@test.com';
   ```

3. **Recreate if needed:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/create-dummy-mechanic-supabase-auth.js
   ```

### If Session Acceptance Fails
Check these fields:
- `can_accept_sessions` should be `true`
- `is_available` should be `true`
- `application_status` should be `'approved'`
- `profile_completion_score` should be >= 80

### If Workshop Affiliation Not Showing
Verify:
- `workshop_id` matches the organization ID
- `invited_by` matches the organization ID
- `invite_accepted_at` is set
- Organization status is `'active'`

## Authentication Architecture

### ‚úÖ Current Setup (Supabase Auth)

Your platform now uses **unified Supabase Auth**:

1. **Auth Layer:** `auth.users` - Handles authentication
2. **Profile Layer:** `profiles` - Stores role (mechanic, customer, admin)
3. **Data Layer:** `mechanics` - Stores mechanic-specific data, linked via `user_id`

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ No legacy `mechanic_sessions` table needed (dropped in migration `20251029000011`)
- ‚úÖ Uses `requireMechanicAPI` middleware (checks `auth.uid()`)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies based on `user_id`
- ‚úÖ Password stored securely in Supabase Auth (not `password_hash` column)

### üîÑ Migration Status

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ `20251029000004_unify_auth_system.sql` - Added `user_id` to mechanics
- ‚úÖ `20251029000011_drop_mechanic_sessions_table.sql` - Removed legacy table
- ‚úÖ `20251029000012_drop_password_hash_column.sql` - Removed legacy column (if exists)

**Not Yet Applied:**
- ‚è≥ `99990009_phase2_fix_type_mismatches.sql` - Changes account_type values
  - This will change `individual_mechanic` ‚Üí `independent` and `workshop_mechanic` ‚Üí `workshop`

## Next Steps for Production

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. **Remove Test Data:**
   ```sql
   -- Delete auth user (cascades to profile)
   DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'workshop.mechanic@test.com';

   -- Delete mechanic record
   DELETE FROM mechanics WHERE email = 'workshop.mechanic@test.com';

   -- Delete workshop
   DELETE FROM organizations WHERE email = 'elite.workshop@test.com';
   ```

2. **Optional: Apply Type Standardization:**
   - Run `99990009_phase2_fix_type_mismatches.sql` if you want standardized enum values
   - Only apply if you've updated all code to use new values

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the database constraints in migration files
- Review RLS policies on mechanics and organizations tables
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Verify Stripe configuration for payment processing
