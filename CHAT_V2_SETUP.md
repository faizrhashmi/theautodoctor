## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Waiting for mechanic" doesn't update when mechanic joins

**Solution:**
- Verify Realtime is enabled for `session_participants` in Supabase
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Refresh the customer's page
- Check that mechanic actually joined (query database)

```sql
SELECT * FROM session_participants WHERE session_id = 'YOUR_SESSION_ID';
```

### Issue: Messages don't appear in real-time

**Solution:**
- Verify Realtime is enabled for `chat_messages` in Supabase
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify both users are in the same session
- Test by refreshing the page (messages should load)

### Issue: File upload fails

**Solution:**
- Verify storage bucket `chat-attachments` exists
- Verify bucket is set to **public**
- Check RLS policies are created (run SQL above)
- Check file size (must be < 10MB)
- Check browser console for specific error

### Issue: Can't download attachments

**Solution:**
- Verify bucket is public
- Check file URL in database is correct
- Try opening URL directly in new tab
- Check RLS policies allow SELECT

### Issue: Chat UI looks broken

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check Tailwind CSS is working
- Check browser console for JS errors
- Try in incognito mode

## Database Queries for Debugging

### Check if Realtime is working
```sql
-- Check subscriptions
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime'
AND tablename IN ('sessions', 'session_participants', 'chat_messages');
```

### View messages with attachments
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  content,
  created_at,
  attachments,
  sender_id
FROM chat_messages
WHERE session_id = 'YOUR_SESSION_ID'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### Check storage bucket
```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'chat-attachments';
```

### View uploaded files
```sql
SELECT
  name,
  bucket_id,
  created_at,
  metadata
FROM storage.objects
WHERE bucket_id = 'chat-attachments'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
